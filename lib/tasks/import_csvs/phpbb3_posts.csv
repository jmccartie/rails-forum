Your observation is pretty valid though.  In many mags, forums, videos, etc. you see route and problem ratings ranging up and down on the whim of the source.  Not real sure there's ONE reason for this, but in the magazines' case I would guess that they are trying to magnify the sport's heroes.  Hero worship sells mags and gear, which puts more money into the industry - not necessarily a bad thing.

Nothing at all intended against Lisa, but she is definitely a hero to many climbers.  And while the difference between a V5 and V6 is minimal to most, it is huge to those that can't climb the grade.

I think this is the only unbiased way in which to write a guide.  Many of the ratings shown in my Santa Monicas books were higher than I thought they should be, but represented the consensus opinion I received from folks who frequented those areas.  In hindsight, perhaps I should have modified a few of the grades, but overall I think I did the right thing.

It was wonderful watching everyone getting stronger every week.  Now I see Paul and Robert and everyone (who's still climbing) continuing to get even better.

While Steele Valley is not of the caliber of those two areas, it does have a lot of developed problems and potential for many more.

The climbing is somewhat similar to other Riverside and San Diego bouldering areas, but the amount of rock out there puts it in a league of its own.

Currently there are over 300 problems from VB to V11, but there is room for much harder problems.  In fact, there are some that have been tried off and on over the years and will definitely go, but will be well into the double digits.  There are enough classics already established to keep you busy for a few trips, but most people will feel the pull of the undeveloped rock that surrounds the established zones.

For the most part the rock is good quality granite and most of the holds are either slopers or crisp little patina-type crimps.  Problem lengths vary from short little things with just a few hard moves to well into the highball range.  There are a few really steep things there, but the angles are more on par with what can be found in the Buttermilks and the other Bishop area granite options.

The area is approached on legal dirt roads and most of the area is on BLM land.  There are some great circuit areas that we had first climbed at back in the late 90's, but they are on privately owned land and some of that land has since been built on (homes).

Once the weather cools more, it will be the perfect time to check it out.  I'd like to see the area get more traffic and development as I have not been out there regularly since around 2001.  There's plenty left to do there and the area could really become something with some more work.

There have been a number of pics posted over on rockclimbing.com if you want to see what some of it looks like.  Here's a link to the area page over there:

in the case of Clawing at the belly of the beast, Ryan Held was the only person to climb the thing at the time that I finished the guide, so I had no choice but to rely solely on his opinion.

y2k - I knew that Matt Beebe gave it a V9 or 10 rating when he Fa'd it, but several people that I know repeated it quickly and gave it a V8 rating. At that point I could have given it a 8/9 rating, but I hear people complain about split ratings so I try to avoid them, and given Jtree's tradition of sandbagging, I concluded that V8 was acceptable.

Pumping Monzonite - this answer is much more complex. The 1st edition of Shermans Hueco guide lists Pumping Monzonite as an equivilent of V8, plus we were climbing it from a little lower than the oldschool start, which made it even harder still. I felt that, given the historical status of the problem, rerating it would be disrespectful to Jtree and to the past generations of Jtree boulderers. And that goes the same for alot of older problems in Jtree. Unless somethings breaks or the problem changes, I think that these older climbing areas should be considered fulcrums to guage ratings, to prevent grade inflation.";;"0";"EA==";"ml23u4ix";"1";"0";;"3";"0";"0"

The hoards definitely concentrate, namely at Swingdance and the Cube!
A few people are no doubt putting up most of the bouldering there though. Contrary to what A-ron thinks, I haven't really put up very many problems there. Climbed most of them though.

I can tell you that 4 or 5 years ago when I started to seriously suss out Tram with the intent of writing a guide for the place, I estimated that there were around 300 problems. During the course of assembling the book, the damn area grew and grew.  I ended up re-organizing the book over and over, finally I just had to stop adding problems. I listed about 800 problems, maybe another 100 have gone up since then. Since the book was finished I have had time again the explore at tram, and have immediately stumbled upon several new areas (to me). It seems that there were several areas that hard core locals did not want to be in this edition of the book. Anyways, in the past 2 or 3 months, I have seen some of the best problems that I have seen at Tram period. Enough to fill another book! It was like having a whole new climbing area plopped in our laps. I also suspect that these same locals have even more areas at Tram that they are keeping quite about.

WTF?[/quote:1y6vy0in]

V2 and V3? Did all the sand fill up to the rim?  I've never heard Anabel referred to as V3.  In fact we rarely saw other climbers besides our crew do it. Maybe something broke...

I am a stickler for consensus ratings and beta before putting anything in a vid.  Even after getting multiple opinions, sometimes things slip through, but I'd still have to disagree with you on Not Even and Anabel.  If they are easier than the Soul Cal ratings I wouldn't go lower than V5 for Anabel and V3 for Not Even. (Is it still a jump start?)

Pirate's Cove was key before Rockreation opened... Rob Mulligan would run laps on the traverse and tourists would get psyched and take upside down diggers on the sand... When the Santa Anas were kicking, we were there everyday after school.

Anyone else have an opinion on the Anabel, Not Even ratings?

I am reciting the consensus rating from over 30 years of people climbing the thing. You don't call Full Service V11, you don't call High Plains Drifter V8, and you don't call So High V6. This isn't 8a.nu, you can't just go around throwing out any number you feel like. 

So High wasn't even the point of my rant. I was bashing the article itself, the person who wrote, and the magazine that published it. These people in the media should be obligated to report accurate information. Are we really going to respect Lisa for climbing a V6 more than a V5...please. And did they really have to spew the rating that many times, did they want to make sure that we didn't forget that she was climbing a V6[/quote:34stb53r]

Oh RTM , we love you buddy. V5 is the rating and I understand your point.
Overrating is classic 8a.nu style because a v5/6 gives you more points than just plain ol V5.  I'd also be willing to bet that whoever wrote the article IS NOT A ROCK CLIMBER and has probably never been to Joshua Tree in the first place, let alone pulled onto So High.  This is classic climbing &quot;industry&quot; - People writing about things they have no fucking clue about, cause they don't climb.  I see a million people at the trade show and online and then go climbing to see 2 maybe 3 people actually at the crag doing what everyone else is talking about.

This may be why other producers choose not to put grades in their vids at all.  I'll probably never do that though, cause I like to know what a route is  even if the grade is in the general vicinity... I think it gives a problem much more context and can motivate you more to go try it.";;"0";"gA==";"zvtigrl9";"1";"1192166080";;"6";"1";"0"

I went to the specialist today and the good news is the knee is bruised/strained. I am being told to take one month off and ride a stationary bike with little resistance and Naproxin 500mg twice a day for a month.

So, this is my modified plan:

20 minutes on the bike on level three. This is literally no workout. My heart rate is at 80. This is boring. I am following this up with one-legged system training. I plan to do 100 move sessions every other day. I figure I can keep the core strong and since the wall is small I can control the falls and rest the knee. I am going to stay off the rock until I go to SB in two weeks.

Wish me luck. I hate resting injuries.

Obviously no one is going to bring back the B scale, but personally I can't really differentiate between many problems given widly differing V grades. I think certain boulder problems cater to a persons strength or can exploit a certain weakness, things like reach finger size etc. To me that makes it rather pointless to try and assign a specific number to one of these things. I suppose however if you're a climber operating at the top end of the spectrum you need to continually create bigger numbers and the V scale allows for that. Since I am not I guess the numbers just don't really matter to me that much.

There is certainly an abundance of climbing and potential, but does volume of rock equate to quality of climbs? There is an area in Vegas called Mecca. Mecca has ten times the potential of the Tram, but the area is only worth one visit at best. The climbing at the Tram again is good. I would definitely send people there. There are some classics and I am sure since the last time I was there there are more, but the rock quality is what it is and it is not Hueco or Font. I consider those areas to be top quality. I would say in So Cal Black Mountain has the best rock quality. The Underground although limited is the closest thing to Hueco and the Tram is better then Josh. Stoney is fun, but aside from the history just that. That is my 2 cents.

It must really have been a long time since you last visited Tram.  The rock quality at Tram is far superior to that of Black Mtn.  No it's not Hueco or Font, but it's a hell of lot closer, and you don't have to jump through the hoops you do at Hueco.  Anyway last time I checked neither of those areas were in Socal.  The best thing about Tram is that I have a feeling that despite the 800 or so problems RTM will have listed in his guide the best prolems are still out there waiting to be found.";;"0";"gA==";"1ldjudqv";"1";"0";;"10";"0";"0"

I must comment on the &quot;probe&quot; section and the climb-it review of holds. What I thought was a real &quot;probe&quot; on whatever was covered has amounted to nothing but a pr piece for climb-it. their latest holds break and tear off the wall, and it's not just random holds, it's shapes that were dependent on the old material that now is unsuited to the new material. why wasn't that noted?

The black light setup was fucking awesome and it took a shit load of work to keep the awesome black light feel and still let the climbers be able to see what was going on.

About 40 people competed which I think is a damn good turnout for a Wednesday night especially considering a lot of people already have plans on Halloween. It was also really fun to have everyone competing in costumes... there were some really cool ones out there.

The Top 3 in each category were

Women Beginner
1. MY
2. Jordan
3. Jenny

Women Advanced
1. Laurel Shimamura
2. Taylor (Can't remember her last name)
3. Deanna Lapine (Might be wrong spelling of last name.)

Men Beginner
1. Timothy Lui
2. Alex Hoffman
3. Daniel Lyons

Men Advanced
1. Steve Lapine
2. Brady Held (myself)
3. Norman (Don't know last name but he's got long ass black hair.)

The winners of the four categories all received Mad Pads which was pretty cool considering that it wasn't a high profile comp. They also gave away a bunch of Five Ten and Mad Rock stuff for the free raffle.

Overall it was a pretty damn good comp and I think we are going to be doing more of these black light comps in the future so I'll keep ya'll posted.

I just assume I have more to learn if I struggle on it. Y2K? I felt it was v8, and still do. My new line to the right, starting at Y2K, called tentatively Right2K and going to the right arete then up, is possibly one grade harder. 

For me, learning is always the preferred option in contrast to complaining about what I can't do, or what seems very hard. Josh requires a huge amount of foot trust and foot usage. Balance is equally important. After climbing Jtree for almost 3 decades, I feel that what sets it apart from other crags is a much higher degree of frictional trust than any other rock type. Without it, the moves just feel harder. This makes the conditions all the more important. Josh doesn't necessarily favor strong fingers. 

I think the most accurate a rating can be is within 2 grades, or say a v7 or v8. With so many body types and climbing strengths and weaknesses, chances are no one will agree on one number. That said, if it's called v6 or v9, those are just 1 grade differences from anyone's specific grade of v7 or v8. 

What I mean is if on a given day, i send something and think it's v7, then return and repeat it several times over months, and find it more a kin to v8, I personally wouldn't feel like I sandbagged someone if I told them initially it was v7. Another person who rates it v9 would be within my 2 grade rule for accuracy (my final v8 and their v9 rating), making the original v7 rating only two numbers off someone else's rating. 

So what constitutes a sandbag? Good question. If a vote was taken on rating Pumping Monzonite, the final computed average might be something like v7.692 (hypothetical example). So is v7 wrong? Is v8 wrong? Is v6 or v9 wrong? Maybe these latter two are not within the &quot;accepted&quot; numbers for such a well known problem, but I wouldn't call them sandbag. On the other hand, if a guide book printed PM as v6, having been repeated so often, it would be sandbag. But with climbs that have minimal repeats, that much deviation is not extreme. In other words, I differentiate between some one's off the cuff comment of a rating with what a guidebook might publish it as.

Sidenote: All Washed Up is an excellent example of what josh rock is all about and calling it v7 seems a bit high to me, but calling it v6 is simply not a sandbag. how could it? It's one rating different given so many different types of people and styles of climbing.";;"0";"CA==";"lmg98az5";"1";"0";;"30";"0";"0"

Sick party Aron!  The ostrich was glamorous.

Debated whether or not to share this here but figured why not?
So I get home Sunday morning and am pretty tipsy so just strip down and climb into bed.  Well I get up with a splitting headache to look down at my underwear from the night before.  At first they looked soiled.  <!-- s:? --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" /><!-- s:? --> Upon further inspection I realized that they had a huge hole and a bunch of dried blood.  <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" /><!-- s:shock: --> Thoughts start flashing through my head... was I gang raped?  was I having my first period?  Well I make it to the bathroom to &quot;inspect&quot; and find a two inch gash on my right butt cheek.  Turns out, the jeans I was wearing had a bent button that created some &quot;friction&quot; upon hurling myself repeatidly headfirst over the slide on the bounce house.

apparently jumping off of a 25' roof onto the bounce house inflicts pain as well. A slight case of whiplash always feels good in the morning. Alcohol was not an influence in this one. I had been looking at this before the party started and brushed it off, but after watching a bunch of drunk retarded emo kids do it. . . .


. .  . Barracho Bouldererist decided that once everyone left, it was time to try it ourselves. Barracho just might have bottomed out and seriously bruised his tail bone but was heavily inebriated so pain was put off until morning. I lucked out by not bottoming out, just slamming my chin into my stomach. 


All in all, good times were had, costumes were cool, music was. . .well. . interesting, and the turnout was pretty good.

Joe fell at the Ventura gym last night and busted up his leg pretty good. His femur broke in half in the dead center of his left leg. It was pretty fucking terrible as I'm sure you all can imagine. The paramedics took him to Ventura county hospital where he had surgery to put a metal rod down the center of his leg.

Not suprisingly Joe treated the whole incident with a pretty comical attitude, joking with the paramedics and hospital staff and having all of us cracking up. I talked to him this morning and he sounds like nothing even happened... though he will be pretty debilitated for a while.

Erin (the wife) and I left Santa Monica around 7:30a to meet up with [url=http&#58;//www&#46;socalbouldering&#46;com/forum/profile&#46;php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23:1vzyzntx]B_Held[/url:1vzyzntx] and [url=http&#58;//www&#46;socalbouldering&#46;com/forum/profile&#46;php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53:1vzyzntx]2Stars[/url:1vzyzntx] at the tram.  After stopping for some decent coffee, we made good time and arrived at the Tram station at 9:40a.  

After paying our fees (I've GOT to get an annual pass), I saw two gents stroll in with pads.  &quot;Is one of you Brady?&quot;  ... &quot;yeah, he is&quot; and matt pointed to his friend.  we introduced each other and hopped on the tram.  

Erin and I followed Matt and Brady down the path towards the ranger station.  We were looking for &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; (v9), but all we knew was it was &quot;above the ranger station.&quot;  5-months pregnant Erin decided to opt out and watch all our stuff as the other 3 of us spread out along the mountainside.  After about 15 minutes, Matt called out that he'd found the boulder.  

We warmed up on Honeypots (v2):

[img:1vzyzntx]http&#58;//mccartie&#46;com/gallery/d/6970-2/IMG_0654&#46;jpg[/img:1vzyzntx]

I told Matt and Brady that VP was out of my league, but after watching them on the seam, i took a few shots at it.  I managed to work my way up the seam, but the long reach out left was too much for me.  Brady made it look easy.

Me on Vanishing Point

Around 1pm, Erin and I left Brady and Matt and struck out towards the Cube.  Unfortunately, all the rock arrows I left just off the path pointing towards the Cube had been moved, so I missed the exit on the first pass.  Once I remembered the exit, though, we struck off up the small valley.  Following [url=http&#58;//www&#46;socalbouldering&#46;com/forum/profile&#46;php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5:1vzyzntx]a.ron[/url:1vzyzntx]'s crude map, I managed to spot Green Tea Arete and worked on that a bit.

[img:1vzyzntx]http&#58;//mccartie&#46;com/gallery/d/6994-2/IMG_0681&#46;jpg[/img:1vzyzntx]

I had it written down as a V3 -- maybe if I knew it was a V4, I would have tried a little harder.  <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->  Either way, I couldn't figure it out and opted for something easier with a better landing.

We cruised to the Cube.  On my last trip up in July, I'd tried The World's Hardest V2 (v1), and managed to thoroughly piss myself off that I got shut down.  In my frustration over not sending Green Tea Arete, I promptly sent.  Unfortunately, the video of my second send was sloppy as hell:

Again, using a.ron's map, and the GPS that [url=http&#58;//www&#46;socalbouldering&#46;com/forum/profile&#46;php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3:1vzyzntx]rtm[/url:1vzyzntx] had given me, we moved west trying to find either Standing on the Head of the Dragon (v4) or Buddha Belly Arete (v2).  I missed the Dragon (managed to find it on our way out), unfortunately.  When I saw there'd be some hiking up hill again, I left Erin and struck out to find the Buddha.  After about 15 min, I finally found the boulder and hiked back down to get Erin and the gear.  

I warmed up on this thing (know what it is?).  About 10 yards downhill from Buddha: 

[img:1vzyzntx]http&#58;//mccartie&#46;com/gallery/d/7006-2/IMG_0693&#46;jpg[/img:1vzyzntx]

Looked like there was a hard sit start, but I did an easy stand start to get the blood flowin'.  Unfortunately, I think I made a big mistake that day -- I worked too long on a hard problem (Vanishing Point), and it burned me out.  My arms just gave out after about my 2nd try -- after that it was diminishing returns.  It didn't help that the ledge just before the top is also covered in dirt and lichen and I couldn't get in a good position to clean it off.  Either way, this problem was really cool, and I'll definitely make a return trip to finish it off.

[img:1vzyzntx]http&#58;//mccartie&#46;com/gallery/d/7009-2/IMG_0702&#46;jpg[/img:1vzyzntx]

On our way out, I luckily spotted the Dragon off in the trees.  I'll be coming back to that next time as well.

And that's it.  It was already 4:30pm and the sun was going down.  Here's what I learned:  have a strategy.  Want to send a ton of climbs?  Don't work on a climb 4 grades above your current highest.  It'll burn you out and won't leave you anything to send with.  Or, choose to screw around on something hard, take pictures and have fun, but don't expect to send measly V2's later on in the day.  I got a little greedy and wanted to do both.  <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->

Off to Palm Desert from Wed night through Sun morn...family reunion.  I ate way too much food.  God bless the La Quinta Thanksgiving buffet.

My wife is cool.  She agreed to change up our schedule to accommodate a trip to Jtree before we head back to LA.  Sunday morning, we drove out to the south entrance and drove through the whole park, ending up at Cap Rock.  I'd never gone through the south way, so it was nice to mix it up.

I didn't have my bouldering guide, so I was going off memory.  I quickly found Fry boulder just off the road.  We parked near Cap Rock, hiked along the nature loop, and peeled off towards Fry.  What a cool problem!  It took me a few tries, but I managed to figure out the starting move and got the rest fairly quickly.

We then cruised over to Stonehenge and found Picture Perfect.

Then I took Erin to Real Hidden Valley to have our lunch.  Until that day, Erin had only been to Jtree once.  And it sucked.  I rolled the dice and got us a campsite back in May for Memorial Day.  We baked and she hated it.  We ended up cutting the trip short and going to Palm Springs and the tram (my first trip up).

After a day of hiking all over the Tram, Josh was a nice change for her since the approaches were quite easier.  We grabbed lunch, and I took some pictures of So High, etc. for [url=http&#58;//mountainproject&#46;com/v/california/joshua_tree_national_park/real_hidden_valley/106048550?highlightphrase=so+high&amp;:1vzyzntx]Mountain Project.[/url:1vzyzntx]

Block Party, v3, Shipwreck Boulders.  My first flashed v3 at Josh.

We cruised off to Manx boulders.  If I had something left, I wanted to work on Undertow.  Someone posted on one of my other trip reports that I was missing out by doing the other problems at Manx and skipping Undertow.  

First, I did an old favorite: The Boxer Problem (v2)

Then set to work on Undertow.  I flashed it.  Sweet.

Unfortunately, I ran out of memory card during the video.  I tried to shoot more video (after 3 successful sends), but was burned out.  Ah well.  Happy with the flash.  <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->

To finish off our day, we drove over towards the Outback so I could take some more pictures for Mountain Project ... this time of False Hueco.  I did the traverse (v2) which was fun.  

[img:1vzyzntx]http&#58;//mccartie&#46;com/gallery/d/6944-2/IMG_0899&#46;jpg[/img:1vzyzntx]

I started to work on the Torquemeister (v4), but my right arm gave out.  All done.

We left the park and cruised out to the 10 freeway, where we managed to sit in stop-and-go traffic for about an hour until we hit Riverside.  I think this was the only time I didn't care I was sitting in traffic ... good climbing days do that to ya.

I was SO digging the idea of a Steele Valley Saturday + Tram or Josh Sunday.  :sigh:

Latest forecast shows some rain the night before and a very slight chance in the way early morning on Saturday.  Due to the rock type out there everything drys almost immediately, so I think we're looking good even if the moisture does arrive.

Looking forward to showing you guys what I think has the potential to become a really nice local area.

Brady - It's going to be bitter cold up there, so unless you want to go for a tram ride just to get drunk at a higher altitude you should come play.

The Tram is clearly the best.  Not only due to quantity, but also average rock quality.  There is some amazingly good rock at Black Mountain, but by and large the crystals there are bigger = sharper holds and features when all is said and done.

I think it's great that we all live somewhere that so many different opinions exist.  That, perhaps more than anything else, is a testament to the great bouldering options we have at our disposal.

Anyways... my reason for disliking Steele Valley is last time I was convinced to go by someone that said there was endless potential. I ended up walking around for 3 hours looking for some fresh un-climbed-on rock and ended up finding only one boulder that looked worth trying out of hundreds. Maybe I was just searching in the wrong spot but I covered a couple acres of boulders and found only one climb that looked cool. That was very unmotivating... especially after climbing at the Tram a lot where an equal search would yeild tons of potentially good problems.

Aside from the slopes that we added problems to, I have not looked too extensively on the surrounding hillsides.  I'd sure like to think that there was equal potential on those other slopes, but perhaps I'm wrong in that assumption.

And I would certainly agree that when compared to the Tram, this place blows.  The main appeal for my repeated trips back in the late 90's was it's convenience and short distance from my home and work.

At the very least, I know of a half dozen lines that are good and will certainly be double-digit.  I'd like to see those climbed at some point since I can't seem to succeed on them.  Aside from that there are some good, harder problems that I'd hope to see repeated.

Not sure how effective that was, but I hope a few people were somewhat inspired.  Sounds like Robert may not have been too psyched.  My goals take me away from bouldering and places like this, but I could see the place being taken a lot further.  Hopefully that will occur.

after the day at Steele Valley, I crashed at a.ron's, then headed out to Josh Sunday morning.  

i tried to find some of a.ron's friends from rockreation, but they weren't around.  so i headed out to find some new stuff.

parked on the main road, in a turnout just west of Steve Canyon.  headed west.  warmed up on Don't Mess With Texas (v1):
[img:3orms7w9]http&#58;//i231&#46;photobucket&#46;com/albums/ee88/jmccartie/joshua%20tree/IMG_0946&#46;jpg[/img:3orms7w9]

then i did Western Roll (v3).  on the way out, i did Lip Service (v2).  

had some cup o' noodles in the back of my car in the turnout and watched some folks do Season Opener ( 5.8 ) on the west wall of Steve Canyon.  after lunch, i went off looking for Lizzy Boulder.

i managed to pass it the first time, but backed up and found it.

Finally, my first V4 at Joshua Tree!  (I didn't like the &quot;Fred Nicole&quot; crimper, so i skipped it...might have made it easier...but i'm counting it!)

The music in this video certainly suited the mood of the day...very chill.  i think i saw 5 people the whole day.  and perfect weather.  no winds.  about 50-55deg.

after taking another 4-5 laps on NSTL, I went off to work Roof Romp (v4) around the corner (north) of White Rastafarian.

i figured out the beta, but couldn't stick one of the last moves getting out the roof.  managed to tweak my shoulder.  no send today.

watched the sunset, ran by aron's to check how his Christmas lights were coming, then found me a DoubleDouble.

I know that rtm has other shots of those problems that actually feature area locals or the actual boulderer that got the FA of the problem.

In a regional article like this, I would have much rather have seen local climbers represented instead of seeing UC Mag's friends get the exposure.

Climbs the best quality rock I've found in the entire area.  

It's about 30 feet tall and gets progressively steeper the higher you get until you suddenly realize that it's too late to downclimb or to escape off to the left or right.  At that point it really is easier to keep on going.  

There are no real handholds on the thing and the climbing is insecure all the way to the top.

first off, I think its cool that UCmag took an interest in doing the article. I hear that its one of the biggest (pagewise) articles that they have ever done. 

IMO, they kinda butchered the piece that I wrote, removing all of the creativity that could have made it interesting and memorable reading. And they definitely went a little thick on the Ivan Greene. I think they should have used more variety of climbers in the photos, namely my gurl, who has done more for tram bouldering than any other female.

Recently ran into him at the Quarry, where he and his partner were having difficulty with the crux moves on one of routes there.  I tried to help him with some beta, but he questioned the beta and (once again) my ability to have done the route.  I had been cleaning on another new route that morning, was tired and had not yet done any climbing.  Regardless, I could not walk away from the confrontation.  Instead, I put on my shoes and climbed the route.  Using my beta, both he and his partner were able to do the crux moves, but not once have I received an apology for this or any prior (or later) actions.

4. Design
5. Weight

Good on short back slappers and also nice for highball landings. I saw two major strikes against it, prior to buying. First, it's $400. I found a good deal on eBay, so you may look around a bit. Second, its weight; definitely a heavy pad, but it's actually pretty comfy to hike around. I'd rather hike with it than my old, lighter pad any day. Easily sucks up shoes, chalk, guides, and stuff. My only downside is that it takes up a bit more room in the car. Nice that you can crush it down for flights or longer trips (however, it takes 24 hrs for the cells to &quot;open&quot; again so you can boulder).

I posted the question about the Tram article largely because of my ambivalence toward it.  I am excited to see some friends receive recognition and $.  However, I know that Rob's words were adulterated and was curious to what extent.

Since you asked -- I guess I think there could be better synthesis between the text and pictures.  It seems that the premise of the piece is that the Tram has housed surges of development, followed by inactivity and that generally it is under-utilized and under-appreciated by the so cal masses.  Accordingly, there could be photos of Mulligan, March, Mills along with the numerous other developers I am too new to the Tram to know. I definitely appreciate the excellent photo of Joe.  In fact, all of the photos are excellent - congrats to Damo &amp; Rob! As a Tram devotee and bouldering porn junkie I would have liked to see more.";;"0";"mA==";"1q5nuq93";"1";"0";;"11";"0";"0"

Day 1:

After a quick 4-hour drive from Santa Monica, we awoke in our warm hotel room at the Holiday Inn Express.  We cruised over to Denny's for some Moons Over My Hammy, then headed north to the Happy Boulders.  My poor Toyota sedan was not a huge fan of the washboard road, but we made it to the parking lot at the base of the valley in good time.

From atop Heavenly Path, looking south

We warmed up near The Gleaner, then Sonja and I took turns on the Monkey Hang (v3) while Scott made a few passes and eventually sent Rave (v7).  I took a few burns on the v5 stand start but couldn't lock off on the sloper.  Aron had disappeared up on the hillside...no report on that adventure.  I managed to get Joseph (v3) before moving on.

Sonja promised to give me a tour of the fun/easy stuff, so we headed further up into the valley.  We started out on some high thin stuff: Path (vB) and Heavenly Path (v1).

Sonja sends her old nemesis, Heavenly Path

We then cruised over to the north face of More Water, Less Power and took a few laps (many eliminates and variations).  Happy Hooker (v0+) on the right, Grant's Christmas Present (v1) right to left, and Comfort of Home (v2/3) on the left side.

Jon sends Grant's Christmas Present

Afterwards we climbed up to the rim of the valley and joined Aron and some friends from Rockreation (OC).  Aron had flashed Little Country Girl (v6), but couldn't repeat it for the cameras.  I got Craig Gilbert to demonstrate it along with Big City Boy (v6), just behind it.

[url=http&#58;//s231&#46;photobucket&#46;com/albums/ee88/jmccartie/bishop-dec07/?action=view&amp;current=MVI_0988&#46;flv:2kwz5fnu][img:2kwz5fnu]http&#58;//i231&#46;photobucket&#46;com/albums/ee88/jmccartie/bishop-dec07/th_MVI_0988&#46;jpg[/img:2kwz5fnu][/url:2kwz5fnu]

Craig flashes Big City Boy

Brad Gobright wanted to take a shot at The Hulk (v5/6), so we all packed up and headed back down to the valley.  Sonja and I joined another group to work on Solaruim (v3).  Brad made quick work of The Hulk -- yelling for a spot at the top because no one had seen him sneak up the problem.  I ticked Rendezvous With An Alien (v3) on the east face of Solarium, while the others groped the holds of Redrum (v7) but no one attempted it.  

On the way out, I hurried ahead of the group to try my hand at Groundwater (v5).  I pulled it out after my 3rd try -- my first outdoor v5.  Not too exciting of a climb, but memorable nonetheless.

the field just south of the parking lot

Back at the hotel, we were very thankful for the jacuzzi, pool, and sauna.  We met up with Brad and Nick (a friend of Aron's camping out at the buttermilks for a week).  Nothing like a pitcher of margaritas on an empty stomach.  After dinner, we loitered at Wilson's then made our way back to the hotel.  Brad and Nick continued their cold-weather avoidance by attending an 8:30p showing of &quot;I Am Legend.&quot;

Back at the hotel, Scott made the most of his evening by playing online poker from bed while his son slept.

Day 2

We decided to save some cash and hit the Holiday Inn continental breakfast.  I was delightfully surprised.  Oatmeal, cereal, two hard-boiled eggs, orange juice, and yogurt.  Free.  Booyah.

We stopped by Vons on the way out of town to pick up some veggie goodness for Sonja.

Looking down the trail from the top of the approach

We warmed up on Spacehopper, Bouncing Babies, and Sleeping Gas -- all behind Molly.  We then moved over to the Molly Boulder.  Sonja sent The Great Dominions (v1), Aron and I sent Head Heritage (v3), and Scott and Aron sent Molly (v5).  Scott got a delightful surprise from someone's dog that decided to take a dump right next to his pad.  Bad dog.

We moved farther up into the valley and joined a few others at Pow Pow (v7/8).  Sonja and I probably could have flashed it, but we didn't want to show up the others there, so I took some pics and video instead.

Anthony sends Pow Pow.  Too bad I ran out of memory card just before he topped out.

Anthony, Brad, and Aron all managed an impressive send.  Afterwards, we  lunched and stopped off to watch some folks on Strength in Numbers (v5):

Then, we cruised over to the Ice Caves.  What an awesome area -- boulders on top of boulders creating a long narrow cave with hard problems galore.  Aron and friends worked on Beefcake (v10), while I spent the rest of my afternoon on Chizam (v5).  I spent way too long using one piece of beta.  After seeing Aron do it differently, I changed my plan of attack and promptly sent -- my second outdoor v5.  Booyah.

Unknown climber on Chizam

Aron topped off his day with a great ascent of It's All About Love (v8).

heading back out to the cars

Another trip to Wilson's to buy my own guidebook, some burgers at Carls Jr in Lone Pine, and away we went.

Note to self:  figure out a way to get more time off work to spend more time in Bishop.

I started screwing around in the boulder area and managed to make a move into a two-finger pocket.  my right ring finger has been sore for a few months, but i can usually get it to cooperate if i warm up properly.  this time, however, it hurt like hell.  

i taped it up good over the weekend, but the happies and sads are all pockets, so i was a bad boy and didn't rest like i should have.  

now the underside of my ring finger hurts whenever i put pressure on it.  (pulling in mostly)  A2 pulley?

any tips?  should i stay off it completely?  or just avoid pockets and tape the crap out of it when i climb (crimps don't hurt, oddly enough).";;"0";"CA==";"1wcuydhy";"1";"0";;"21";"0";"0"

I had some gnarly pain down through the palm of my hand and I couldn't even pick up a large cup or mug with that hand for a while.  Strangely enough, and like you, crimping didn't hurt at all.  

Anyway, I iced it a bit for the first few days.  I waited a couple of weeks to climb on it again and then went back to doing ONLY moves that didn't make it hurt at all.  Slowly, over MONTHS, it got better.

I have not read the Tram article, but I understand they mentioned my name, so now I am famous. Just kidding who cares it was fun in the early days and the reason I know Angus is not Argus is because I put it up. The cover of the mag alone kept me from delving further.

I just look at the article and say, &quot;Cool, the Tram is getting a little recognition as a great climbing area.&quot; I know it probably won't get flooded with people because most climbers don't want to pay a fee to climb. And even if it does so what? They aren't [i:10vdsdk2]my[/i:10vdsdk2] rocks.

Birch put up Somewhere in Time, was repeatedly photographed, but not by their chosen photographer, and he's not a local, he's from England. Further to the point of accountability is the sponsorship game that professional climbers HAVE to play. Birch put in hard work, time and money, and he also has CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome), so his efforts are doubly confounded. I would like to see the mag show sensitivity towards the talent that sent one of the hardest problems in socal and to credit him with a photo which, consequently, will credit his pocketbook in such a low budget sport. Seriously, what little money that goes around to climbers could go to those that work the hardest at putting up the testpieces others, including Ivan, aspire to do one day.

&quot;we shouldn't expect much when strangers publish articles about things they don't know and we love...&quot; 

When is a magazine in a position of not being a stranger? That is the whole point of research, so as to publish an article and not be such a stranger. I guess you can say then that UC mag is only qualified to write and print images on the gunks? 

Yet what exactly is &quot;our attitudes,&quot; as you say: &quot;We will never be satisfied if we expect them to match our attitude towards the tram.&quot; In fact, I would be bummed if they did. But, if &quot;our attitudes&quot; involve reflecting the local scene in words and images then I don't think that's asking much. Isn't at least part of the story involve development, and ongoing exploration? 

The whole point of a magazine is to print for the masses, otherwise, it will go under. And exaclty what are the 'masses' interested in? Maybe it's about what happened....that's my assumption based on the mag using robert to write it--the author of the guidebook. Do the images reflect that? Photos are one of the primary tools for climbers to support, as well as get, their sponsors. So when the photos don't reflect the writing, and the editing doesn't support the story, I think something is amiss. But I guess age makes me a bit bitchy, eh? 

If you choose not to be critical of works published, then so be it, but that's  just your choice. I don't think you are implying I'm supposed to agree with you just because you think it's fitting to '...look at the article and say, &quot;Cool, the Tram is getting a little recognition as a great climbing area.&quot;' Personally, I'm not interested in publicizing the tram, but if it happens then I would like to see it done in a responsible way that is consistent with what is happening. What is a story if it's only displayed from the bias of an outsider? Would you be comfortable knowing stories you read and look at on, say, Pakistan's current political situation and recent assasination of Bhutto to have a new york slant or christian bias? Or would you prefer it to offer information based on what's going on in Pakistan, from Pakistanis, and with local issues and problems considered? I mean, it's your choice, and mine too, and I prefer the truth, as close as they can get to it.

Maybe the craft climbing is simply not that important, and we should feel privileged that UC mag has blessed us with their attention and interest, or maybe that article was just a &quot;tool&quot; for east coast props? You're allowed to be a judge too, not just a bystander. As Howard Zinn says, &quot;you can't stand still on a moving train.&quot;

My position with my original posting is that I've not seen anything new over the last nearly 30 years of climbing articles and images. They're low budget, biased publications used to forward an agenda and satisfy a self image that they think others should aligned themselves with. 

But that's just my possessive and controlling view because their my rocks and mine alone!  <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s:wink: -->  <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s:wink: -->  <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s:wink: -->";;"0";"IA==";"ulb3lmlx";"1";"0";;"30";"0";"0"

This is the case with nearly all major media. Here's the trick: browse through the mag at your local gym or news rack but don't buy it! If enough people do this the mags will go out of business and we won't have to look at any of the slanderous crap they publish! God forbid if I'm reading an article on HP40 and think, &quot;Hey! That looks fucking awesome, I'm south bound!&quot; But at the same moment theres some redneck in Alabama cursing Urban Climber for the blasphemy of an article they published of his local love.

For me magazines inspire me to go out to new areas. That's it. I look at the pictures and if they look cool I might read the article. Either way I know that if I go to the area to play on rocks its not going to matter what some low payed climbing journalist had to say about it.

And about Matt Birch getting paid for the pictures of him that should have been where Fabio... errr Ivan was... yeah it sucks. And I agree it should have been him. But am I upset about it? Not really. If you're trying to make dough as a professional climber and your name isn't Chris or Dave or if your pecks don't fit in a D-cup bra you're probably screwed.

Mainly the point I was trying to make is: who reads any popular media and takes it to heart? I mean ideally... yeah, we should be able to do that. But do you listen to Fox News to find out how you feel about voting? I sure as shit don't. I understand that climbing mags should be different because its a close-knit sport... but wait... its not anymore. The close climbing communities still exist but there are also tons of lemmings in the sport now that will buy mags, read the articles, and worship the sub-par rock gods with huge man tits, and buy whatever they are told to.";;"0";"wA==";"crt59apc";"1";"0";;"23";"0";"0"

I'm glad you've found a way to use the mags for your own purpose, but lets not forget how this all started. I stated my opinion on UC mag's coverage of the tram, and you decided to defend them (why I have no idea except maybe you're on their payroll  <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s:wink: --> ), AND attack me:

Over analysis leads to grumpiness. Or maybe vice versa.

You have consistently tried to put forth your own ideas of how to read a mag. I'm so happy for you. My &quot;agenda&quot; is not about what I do, but what climbers have to deal with in mags. You seem solely concerned with what you want to do, and as such, I can see why you really don't care. But you have to ask yourself how you came about the conclusion on fox news:

But do you listen to Fox News to find out how you feel about voting? I sure as shit don't. 

...without being so critical, eh? 

The term &quot;popular media&quot; is relevant in the general sense of news, but in climbing, it's limited to 3 mags owned by 2 companies. Talk about media consolidation! I would like to think that it's better to be critical and pursue the improvement of mags then to simply not buy them and hope they go out of business as you so eloquently state: 

Here's the trick: browse through the mag at your local gym or news rack but don't buy it! If enough people do this the mags will go out of business and we won't have to look at any of the slanderous crap they publish!

Cheers mate. Hope to hear more of your opinions soon, and to voice mine, only to be insulted as if we were in middle school. I'm truly looking forward to it.";;"0";"gA==";"3dkhh9nk";"1";"0";;"23";"0";"0"

From the gitgo you've been making jabs, so I find your argument and accusations baseless. Anyways, that funny face symbol is a sarcasm comment, but I guess you missed that. That means it's in jest. Again, you missed that... 

Why are you sad that you don't know me? It's odd how you try so hard to categorize me with others you seem to not like. I neither like nor dislike you. I responded to your petty trash talk.

Don't know the exact details, but it seems like the addition will be in excess of 2000 square feet of new terrain, including a bunch of topout climbing.

I think Iggy and Brady have done most of the design work (much of it as they went).  Some sections I'm not a fan of, but there are many areas that I like a lot.  Something there for everyone.  Most importantly the majority of the new terrain complements what they already have very nicely.  There are a couple of steep roof sections that will prep folks for the Priest Draw very well.  Also some big, steep planes in between what's on the front boulders.

Paul Robinson Flashes V13
By Dougald MacDonald

Paul Robinson has flashed Nagual, a “hard V13” at Hueco Tanks, Texas. Robinson “waited two years” to try Nagual, hoping for a successful flash of the 45-degree overhanging wall in the East Spur Maze. The problem was established in 2003 by Fred Nicole and is considered to be a bit harder now because of a broken hold.

Only one other person has reported flashing a V13 problem: Britain's James Pearson, who recently flashed his third problem given 8B (V13), Schule des Lebens in Switzerland.

Robinson, a 20-year-old originally from New Jersey but now living in Colorado, warmed up for the flash with a handful of superb repeats in Hueco, including Slashface (V13) in one hour, Esperanza (V14), and the fourth ascent of Algerita (V13). In August, Robinson made the third ascent of Jade (V15) in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado.

Paul Robinson has made the second ascent of Terremer (V15), the hardest boulder problem at Hueco Tanks, Texas, according to Momentum Video Magazine, which filmed the ascent. Robinson completed the problem on January 1, capping a superb two weeks of climbing during which he has done several V13 and V14 problems, including a flash of Nagual, the first V13 flash by an American.

Switzerland’s Fred Nicole established Terremer at the beginning of 2006. The problem links Diaphanous Sea (V12) and Terre de Sienne (V14), two other Nicole problems on Hueco’s North Mountain. Dave Graham nearly repeated the climb in February 2006 but suffered a nasty flapper and had to give up his attempts.

    Objective.— The closed traumatic rupture of finger flexor tendon pulleys in rock climbers appeared as a new complex finger trauma in the mid 1980s. The objectives of this study are to characterize this injury and to describe diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. A grading system for the severity of pulley injuries was developed and used to set therapeutic pathways.

    Methods.— Six hundred four injured rock climbers were prospectively evaluated from January 1998 to December 2001 with a questionnaire and standard examination protocol. Diagnostic ultrasound was performed in all rock climbers with finger injuries; if necessary, an additional magnetic resonance imaging was done. All pulley injuries were graded according to an introduced pulley-injury score (grade 1–4).

    Results.— Three of four of the most frequent injuries were related to the fingers: pulley injuries accounted for 20%, tendovaginitis for 7%, and joint capsular damage for 6.1%. One hundred twenty-two (20.2%) rock climbers presented an injury of the flexor tendon pulley system, 48 had pulley strains, and 74 had ruptures (a single rupture in 90.5% and multiple pulley ruptures in 9.5%). According to the pulley-injury score, 39% were grade 1, 25% were grade 2, 30% were grade 3, and 6% were grade 4 injuries.

    Conclusions.— Pulley injuries were the most frequent injuries in rock climbers. Whereas grade 1–3 injuries respond well to conservative treatment, grade 4 injuries require surgical repair. We recommend the “loop and a half” technique of Widstrom and colleagues and, alternatively, the Weilby repair. We also recommend postoperative initial immobilization and early functional treatment under external pulley protection.

  


Introduction 

Since Bollen1,2 and Tropet et al3 first reported in 1990 the closed traumatic rupture of a finger flexor tendon pulley in rock climbers, further reports have given various diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations. Although the open injury of the pulley system leads to a primary reconstruction,4 there are no clear guidelines for the procedure with a closed pulley rupture. Whereas the indication for a surgical repair was further spread in the early 1990s, now a nonsurgical approach, at least for a single rupture, is standard.5,6 This attitude is based on biomechanical analyses of the flexor tendon pulley system7–10 as well as the very good functional results of many rock climbers, who underwent only self therapy after pulley rupture. The objectives of this study are to determine the frequency of this injury and to give diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. A severity grading system that can be used to guide treatment of pulley injuries is presented.

Methods 

We prospectively evaluated 604 injured rock climbers during a 4-year period (January 1, 1998–December 31, 2001). Four hundred nineteen (69.4%) athletes were seen during clinical work and were evaluated with a standard questionnaire and examination protocol. One hundred eighty-five (30.6%) athletes were seen during the sport medical care of national (National Championships) and international (World Cup, World Championships) climbing competitions. For evaluation of the climbing difficulty level, the Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme (UIAA) scale was transferred into the metric scale (eg, UIAA 9&#8722; = metric 8.7, UIAA 9 = metric 9.0, UIAA 9+ = metric 9.7). The UIAA scale, ranging from grade 1 to 11, is used for classification of the difficulty of a climb, with grade 1 being the easiest and grade 11 currently being the hardest climbing route. The UIAA scale has an open end. Within a grade, a minus applies to an easy climb for the grade, whereas a plus applies for a hard route for the grade. Climbing level was graded according to the hardest on sight (climber tries the route for the first time) and hardest redpoint route (climber knows the route and its special moves well and has trained on it) within the past 2 years. All rock climbers presenting with the suspicion of a pulley injury also received diagnostic ultrasound and optional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasound was performed in a water tube by using a 7.5-MHz linear ultrasound head. In suspected pulley injury, the pathway in Figure 1 was used.

We developed a grading score (Table 1 ) and used it in this study to aid scientific evaluation and to guide therapy. Grade 1 injuries are pulley strains with no dehiscence between bone and tendon in the MRI or ultrasound (&lt;2 mm). The complete rupture of an A4 pulley has a very good prognosis, sometimes leading to a full recovery within 4 to 6 weeks. This has the same severity as a partial rupture of the more essential A2 or A3 pulley. These injuries are rated grade 2. The complete rupture of the A2 or A3 pulley, leading to a prolonged recovery, is rated grade 3. Grade 4 injuries include complex lesions with multiple pulley injuries or single pulley injuries combined with lumbricalis muscle damage or collateral ligament rupture. These lead to a functional deficit if not surgically repaired. Grade 1–3 injuries received conservative therapy, and grade 4 injuries received surgical repair. Table 2 shows the therapeutic procedure according to the grading.

Results 

Six hundred four rock climbers with acute injuries or overuse syndromes were enrolled in a prospective study during January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2001. The types and extents of the injuries were determined in all athletes. In the 419 (60.4%) athletes seen in our clinic, demographic (age, sex) and sport specific data (climbing levels, years of climbing experience) were also gathered. In this group of 302 men (70.1%) and 117 women (27.9%), the average age was 28.3 years (13–52). The athletes had been sport climbing for an average of 7.3 years (2–35). The interval between the acute injury and medical consultation ranged from a few minutes to 1.5 years. Average redpoint climbing level was metric 8.63 (5.3–11.0) or UIAA 9&#8722;, representing US 5.12c. Average on-sight level was metric 8.09 (5.9–11.3) or UIAA 8, representing US 5.12a.

Of 604 injuries, 247 (41%) were related to fingers, 81 (13.4%) to forearms and elbows, 55 (9.1%) to feet, 47 (7.8%) to hands, 43 (7.1%) to trunks and spines, 42 (6.9%) to skin, 30 (5.0%) to shoulders, 22 (3.6%) to knees, and 37 (6.1%) to other regions. Injuries with a higher grade of severity (polytrauma) were rare (5 cases, 0.8%).

Of 247 finger injuries, pulley injuries were the most frequent (n = 122) followed by tendovaginitis (n = 42) and joint capsular damage (n = 37). Table 3 summarizes the finger injuries and overuse syndromes, and Table 4 summarizes the pulley injuries. According to the proposed grading system, 39% of the pulley injuries were grade 1, 25% were grade 2, 30% were grade 3, and 6% were grade 4 injuries (Figure 2 ). The 50 patients with A2 ruptures included 17 partial and 33 complete ruptures.

THERAPY

Grade 1–3 injuries were treated conservatively with initial immobilization and early functional therapy under pulley protection. In grade 4 injuries, a surgical repair was performed by the “loop and a half” technique of Widstrom et al11 or, alternatively, the Weilby repair.12 Postoperatively, an initial immobilization was followed by functional therapy.

OUTCOME

Follow-up included 87 (71.3%) of all rock climbers with pulley injuries, including all grade 4 injuries. Of the 80 cases treated conservatively (grade 1–3 injuries), 7 (8%) athletes complained of persistent pain after 3 months, caused by posttraumatic tendovaginitis. After local cortisone injection and a prolonged resting period, they regained their initial sport activity level. The other 73 patients returned to full climbing level, with occasional minor pain. Only 6 reported a continuing need of taping the injured finger for longer than 12 months during climbing. All 7 grade 4 patients were re-evaluated: 1 presented a very good functional result, 5 presented a good functional result, and 1 presented a satisfying functional result. One reported a very good sport-specific result with climbing again in the top difficulty levels (UIAA 10, US 5.13d), 3 reported good sport-specific results, 2 reported a sufficient sport-specific result, and 1 reported a poor sport-specific result. Finger taping during climbing activity was necessary in all patients.

Discussion 

As expected, we found a high number of finger injuries within our total group of rock climbers. This is consistent with data in the literature. Bollen,1,2 Rooks,13 and Largiadèr and Oelz14 reported that about 60% of all climbing injuries concentrated on the hand and fingers. Hochholzer et al15 reported a similar finding, with osteoarthritis being the most common and pulley ruptures being the second most common climbing injuries. Considering all finger injuries and overuse syndromes within our group, pulley injuries were the most common. This results from 2 main reasons. First, the Bamberg hospital is located within the Frankenjura, Germany's largest sport-climbing area, which is characterized by short, very steep climbs and requires maximum power moves by using the crimping technique (Figures 3 and 4 ). The crimping finger position seems especially responsible for pulley injuries.1,3,6,8,10 Second, our center is a major referral center for patients suspected of having this injury.

DIAGNOSIS

We propose an algorithm (Figure 1 ) that we use in diagnosing suspected pulley injuries. The clinical picture of pulley injuries and the history from the athletes were in accordance with other studies.1,2,3,6,7,10,16 Most rock climbers reported an acute onset while performing a hard move or slipping off a foothold. Sometimes a loud popping was mentioned. The fingers showed swelling at the level of the proximal or middle phalanx, sometimes accompanied by hematoma. A visible bowstring only occurred in high-grade injuries. When caused by the combined injury of the lumbricalis muscles, an extension deficit of the proximal interphalangeal joint could occur, leading to contraction. According to our algorithm as well as the reports of Gabl et al,16 we always obtain radiographs to exclude fractures or osseous tears of the fibrocartilago palmaris as well as chronic overuse fractures in the epiphysis of adolescent rock climbers.

For further work-up, ultrasound examination and MRI are important. MRI has been demonstrated to be very sensitive in detecting pulley injuries in many studies4,7,15–17 and is widely accepted. Although MRI cannot directly detect the damaged pulley, the T1 sequences show dehiscence of tendon from bone, whereas T2 sequences help distinguish a tendovaginitis (Figure 5 ). Intratendonal lesions can be detected in addition to partial ruptures. MRI is limited by its high costs. Lately, ultrasound examination has been demonstrated to achieve nearly the same quality results, sometimes even being superior to MRI, allowing additional dynamic examination.16–18 We recommend use of ultrasound as the standard examination, with MRI added if the diagnosis remains unclear.

THERAPY

In 1990, Bollen1 and Tropet et al3 first reported rock climbers with closed traumatic pulley ruptures. Both Bollen, with conservative treatment, and Tropet, with surgery, achieved good functional results. During the ensuing years, further reports about surgical and conservative treatment have appeared2,4,7,8,16 but without general guidelines. Whereas surgical repair was commonly used in early years, conservative, nonsurgical approaches are now standard, at least for single ruptures.5,6 This attitude is based on biomechanical analyses of the flexor tendon pulley system7–10 and the very good functional results of many rock climbers, who underwent only self therapy after pulley rupture. An initial strength deficit disappears after 3 to 6 months. Bollen1,2 reported a survey held at the British National Climbing Championships in 1989, where 18 rock climbers showed an increase of “bowstring phenomenon” in their fingers. None of these athletes underwent any kind of previous therapy, but at the time of the competition all had good functionality and few complaints. Gabl et al16 used the MRI and the visible bowstring for indication of conservative or surgical therapy. They applied surgery if the bowstring on the MRI extended proximal to the base of the proximal phalanx of the involved finger. MRI is essential in this approach. Although conservative treatment of single pulley injuries became standard, there was no distinction among the different pulleys themselves. An A2-pulley tear has a prolonged recovery in comparison with an A4 tear. For further scientific evaluation, as well as therapeutic decision making, we developed a grading score (Table 1 ).

CONSERVATIVE THERAPY

Mainly on the basis of biomechanical analyses of Bollen,2 a nonsurgical procedure is becoming standard for single ruptures. Bollen described a tearing force of 500 N of a 1.5-cm wide tape above the A2 pulley, which allows good protection of the pulley. Although Warme and Brooks19 could not find any difference in pulley tearing force with or without taping, conservative therapy has shown very good functional results.1,2,7,8,20 Depending on the interval between trauma and consultation as well as local swelling, we recommend an initial immobilization of 10 to 14 days with a palmar splint combined with anti-inflammatory agents and elevation. Thereafter, treatment consists of early functional therapy with pulley protection by using tape or thermoplastic/soft-cast ring, finger gymnastics, or a Thera-Band Hand Exerciser (Thera-Band, Akron, OH). Easy sport-specific activities are allowed for grade 3 injuries after 6 to 8 weeks under pulley protection (tape). Full sport activities can be done after 3 months, with continued taping for at least 6 months. Grade 2 injuries can be treated in a similar but more rapid fashion (Table 2 ). Initial strength deficit will resolve after 3 to 6 months, and bone-to-tendon dehiscence is stable on ultrasound follow-ups.

SURGICAL REPAIR

Grade 4 injuries require surgical repair to prevent functional deficits. Clinically, there is reduced flexion in the distal interphalangeal joint, and sometimes there is an extension deficit of the proximal interphalangeal joint.4,6,7,16,20 Surgical repair is based on the biomechanical analyses of Lin et al21 as well as the comparison of surgical repairs done by Widstrom et al.11,22 A single stitching of the remaining incomplete rims of the pulleys is insufficient; a plastic repair is essential. The following various methods have been described: the Kleinert and Bennet12 repair based on Weilby's idea, the “belt-loop” technique of Karev et al,23 the “single-loop” technique according to Bunnel,24 the Lister25 repair with retinaculum flexorum, the palmaris longus tendon transplantation through the volar plate according to Doyle,11 the “loop and a half” technique of Widstrom et al,11 and the “triple loop” technique by Okutsu et al.26 Considering the biomechanical analyses of Widstrom et al11,22 and the reports of Hahn and Lanz,4 we favor the loop-and-a-half technique of Widstrom et al with a free transplant of the palmaris longus tendon. Although the Weilby repair12 was reported as having the best functional results, sport climbers often need a higher tearing force after reconstruction. This is provided by the loop-and-a-half technique. Nevertheless, the final decision is made during the operation according to the anatomical situation. For reconstruction of the A3 pulley, the loop-and-a-half technique sometimes is not the ideal solution, as the loop can cause irritation on the extensor tendon at the proximal interphalangeal joint. Postoperatively, we apply an initial immobilization for 2 weeks, followed by an early functional treatment with pulley protection with thermoplastic or a soft-cast ring for 4 weeks and further taping during sport activities. The overall results are good, with nearly full recovery of function.

Conclusion 

Closed traumatic pulley rupture was described as a new injury mechanism in the 1980s, and early diagnostic and therapeutic approaches varied. Today's approach should include the exclusion of a fracture or joint capsular/collateral ligament lesion, followed by ultrasound differentiation of pulley strains and partial, complete, or multiple pulley ruptures. If the ultrasound fails to give an exact diagnosis, an MRI should be performed. Injuries can be graded according to our proposed grading system to guide therapeutic approach. Grade 1–3 injuries (strains and partial or single ruptures) are treated conservatively, with initial immobilization and early functional therapy under pulley protection (Table 2 ). Grade 4 injuries (multiple ruptures) require surgical repair. The loop-and-a-half technique of Widstrom et al11 is favored, with the Weilby repair12 being an alternate approach. Postoperatively, initial immobilization is used, followed by physical therapy. Although closed pulley ruptures were initially seen only in rock climbers, who are subject to high impact on the fingers, these injuries may also occur in nonclimbers. We have seen 4 cases of closed pulley ruptures in nonclimbers within the past 3 years. The trauma mechanism in these involved primarily lifting heavy items with crimped fingers.

That meant no climbing for about six months. This time I had decided I wanted to climb and tried a different tact and healed in a very short amount of time.

I let the finger rest for two weeks and kept the ringer finger tapped to the middle finger, so the injured finger always had support. I began going into the gym and doing a ton of pull ups and climbing easy until I would feel some pain in the finger. Once this would happen I would pack up my stuff and head home. 

Once home I would ice the hand for 10 minutes and then off ten and then back on ten for about an hour. Of course like me you can play a few online poker tournaments this will help the time go by and maybe you can win some money while healing. I did this for about four weeks and after that time I really have had problem with the finger. I continue to tape the ring finger in the gym just as a safety precaution due the volume of climbing done in the gym and the short rests.

If you can check your ego at the door, just climb pain free and not get sucked into trying that &quot;one problem&quot; you have always wanted to do. You will find the healing process can be quite fast. The steeper you climb the more load on your hands. Spend some time climbing lower angle problems and work on your technique and endurance. This will pay off when the finger heals.

[b:33n63gka]McColl Beats Storms to V14 in Bishop[/b:33n63gka]
Canadian Sean McColl snuck in an ascent of Goldfish Trombone at the Happy Boulders in California, as major storms pounded the Sierra. McColl spent two days on the problem, completing it January 6. A roof protected the crux holds from heavy rains, but the finishing holds were wet, and by the next day up to 18 inches of snow lay on the ground in the nearby Buttermilk Country near Bishop. 

Since the end of December, McColl has sent Direction (V13) and Xavier's Roof  (V12) in the Buttermilks; he also flashed a couple of V11 problems and added V11 sit starts to existing routes at the Sads. McColl reportedly is close to completing The Mandala SDS (V13)— once the snow melts. The Bishop forecast is mostly good for this week. 

McColl, 20, a former youth world champion in lead climbing, also had a superb autumn of roped climbing. In October, he made the second ascent of Lucifer (5.14c) and flashed Thanatopsis (5.14a/b) at the Red River Gorge in Kentucky. Before that he completed half a dozen 5.14a and 5.14b routes in Rodellar, Spain, including two on his second go.";;"0";"QA==";"33n63gka";"1";"0";;"21";"0";"0"

It does not necessarily mean that they would close access.  There are several SoCal mountains that do not have the same management level as SanJac.  Look at Baldy and the surrounding wilderness.  Even SanG is only patrolled on a couple of the trails and is managed by a ranger station FAR down the mountain. 

The tram is privately owned and would maintain operation so nothing would change from a approach standpoint.

My biggest concern is that the tram offers easy P2P access to a 9000 foot elevation and a LOT of newbie and ill prepared hikers and tourists visit there.

Women - The only two girls I really remember were Lisa Rands and Alex Puccio. They were both very impressive but Lisa dominated in the finals. Man is she awesome to watch... such a perfect blend of experience, technique and power. So Lisa won, Alex got second, and can't remember the names of the other girls although I did see some climbing pretty darn well.

Men - I'm pretty sure the results for the mens red point section of the comp went (sorry if there's any spelling errors):
1. Kyle Owen
2. Giovanni Traversi
3. Dan Mills
4. Carlo Traversi
5. Julian Babtista
6. Michael Babtista
7. Garret Greggor
8. Jason Campbell
9. Anthony Terascio

The finals (4 problems in which each climber had 5 minutes to work) were somewhat evenly matched amongst all the finalists, with each person excelling on climbs that seemed to suit their styles. The two standouts were Dan Mills and Carlo Traversi. 

Dan flashed the first three problems but struggled on the first crux of the last problem. Carlo flashed the first and third problem but took a few tries to complete the second. However, Carlo dominated on the last problem, falling off with his hand wrapped on the finishing jug.

I didn't stick around for the reading of the results but I would think Carlo took first place having gotten further than Dan on the last final. The only reason Dan might have won is if the flash value of the second problem out-weighed Carlo's performance of the final problem.

Once again the comp seemed like a huge success overall. It ran smoothly and the problems were all around very, very good. On a side note there seemed to be no injuries which is very nice.";;"0";"BA==";"2u8aegge";"1";"0";;"23";"0";"0"

I'm sure I'll get plenty of comments from the long time locals, as sooo many of you had different stories as to who did what, when, and how hard things are. That was one of my most difficult tasks. Sorting through all that. Made worse was the fact that the disputing parties were all my friends, and I did not want to take any sides.

unfortunately, i couldn't convince anyone to drive out to Holcomb Valley for the day, but on the way back, we sat in traffic all along the south side of the lake.  i spied some sweet boulders ... probably most of them on are private land though.  i didn't get too many good pics with all the driving.  but what you see here is a fraction of the quality/quantity.

Furthermore, is there a reason there is no archive of these images to view from past home pages? I once wanted to see an image again and remember the name of the problem but had no way to find that image since it was replaced.

It would be great to see images sent in by other people of things happening supported with attendant information. Maybe socalbouldering can have a submission page that gives guidelines on submission requirements along with jpeg sizes, etc.

If anyone has questions, I would be more than happy to give them more info on anything they see on the site. Shoot me an email. So far, I think I have responded to every single email I have ever gotten here at socalbouldering.com



I have a user gallery. The idea was that people who look at the site could send in photos for the gallery, and we could amass this huge base of photos for bouldering around socal. Then I would take some of the best ones and use them for the front page. 
One of the difficulties is that my webguy has yet to set me up with an automated way for people to do this. I tell people to just email the pics. Of the few photos that I have recieved, I loaded them on myself.  sometimes this can take a week or 2 to do this! The other problem is that I hardly ever get any photos from anyone, I practically have to beg people to send stuff in!

It's definitely a unique SoCal destination - my personal favorite for a variety of reasons. I always end up cleaning new problems on every trip. (on our last day up there last fall we added 6 new probs in one little area.) Most of the lines are VO-V3, because of the nature of the rock there. However, there are PLENTY of harder lines to be had. There are hundreds of problems, with lots more potential. There are some pics of some of the latest development in the galleries page, under user galleries. Feel free to add if you have any pics.

The only thing that changes is the big image. More important, that big image lacks depth cause there is no information to support it, or to put it into perspective. You should check out the firstpost.co.uk link on photo essays, or the same at the NYtimes multimedia section, and you will see outstanding images supported by captioning. 

On your site, almost 1/3 of the page is the header, then there is the top 50, user gallery, gym rates, and then the climb-it plug. you go to this site, see these, and they do nothing in the way of give you visual stimuli any more. I have to scroll down just to see the rest of the image or the credits. So I assume when you say visual stimuli, you just mean the image. 

you might get confused the first time at the other sites, but if you want repeat viewers, these things that seem confusing become all too familiar once you visit a few more times. Depth is more important, me thinks.

All of the rest of the images are links on the top and sides. In addition, all of the links down the left side are already located on the top nav bar, so you could move some fresh content (News, RSS feed, etc) to that side and not lose anything. I do like the UK site idea in regards to the amount of fresh content available on the home page. My only critique is it lacks enough imagery to compensate for all of the text. I do like knowing what is going on in the climbing world (local and non-local), so the UK format work better for me.

The front page of this site was the first webpage that I have ever designed. Jason helped me build  the first 10 pages or so, after that, I have added everything else by myself, learning the web program along the way. 

I like to think that this site is still in its infancy. My goal has always been to have boulderers from our community get involved and help to shape the site. So far, despite my plea's, nobody has stepped up ( except Fraction, and to a limited extent A#ron). I guess the problem is that there is no $$$ involved, so anybodys time spent, including mine, is done only for personal satisfaction. That said, I have a huge list of things to do on the site. I will indeed change and move things around on the front page as time goes on.

When i look around at other sites, I see very few front pages that do not involve scrolling. I have read webdesign books that say that some people prefer to navagate by the nav bar, others like to hunt around for something that catches thier eye, so its best to have multiple links to various pages in different spot on the front page. Every time I add something new to the site (which is several times a week), I do put something about it with links on the top right side of the page. 

Golfer - This site is for socalbouldering, so I am only going to add content and news that relates to bouldering around so cal. 

Satya - How can I possibly, by myself, create a site that compares with the NY times site? They prolly have a HUGE budget, and pay a whole team of web experts to maintain their site. If I have more info to add to the fp photo I will, just for you. 

a@roN - the forum should open in its own window, so linking back to the front page would create multiple windows open with socalbouldering on them.

I see the logic here but to be perfectly honest, I have the forum page linked to my favorites but not the regular homepage.  Let's be realistic, the forum page changes a lot more than the homepage (several times a day in fact) so it makes more sense to check it more often.  So I still agree with Aron, it'd be nice to have a link back to the homepage which could also open up in a new window.

This seems to be a bit weird. I'm gonna assume you are fine with site criticism such that I'll continue to comment on this thread. 

I don't see the relevance in that it's your first site design. You say you want help, and the site will get shaped by the community of boulderers; if so, then why are you so bothered by my comments? I'm taking time out to comment on what I find lacking or that could be improved. If you don't like it, that's cool. And if you think the changes could be good, then great. Simple as that. 

&quot;So far, despite my plea's, nobody has stepped up ( except Fraction, and to a limited extent A#ron). I guess the problem is that there is no $$$ involved, so anybodys time spent, including mine, is done only for personal satisfaction.&quot; 

I've never heard a single &quot;plea&quot; from you, rtm, and I don't think it's fair to assume that $$$ is the only motivator. I really have no idea what kind of help you want--you simply have never said a single thing.

I mentioned the nytimes and firstpost solely for the photo essays and their captioning. I NEVER compared your site to the nytimes. I want to repeat that: I NEVER compared your site to the nytimes. PERIOD. This is what I said:

&quot;You should check out the firstpost.co.uk link on photo essays, or the same at the NYtimes multimedia section, and you will see outstanding images supported by captioning.&quot;

Captioning! That was my point. 

I don't understand how you can explain yourself with that fact that you've only done one site design, then explain how you've read so many books on design. When I edited Shut Up and Climb, I sucked at editing. For the most part, I still do. Welcome to the real world; it's hard to do something without a formal education. If you can't see the logic in adding information, then don't do it. And certainly don't do it for me. 

You act like you have it all figured out, then you excuse yourself with a lack of experience. If you don't want input or criticism, fine. I'll stop. It does me no good to speak up, and have you behave like a child whining. Personally, I find speaking up in the forum a real PAIN IN THE ASS. I don't for personal satisfaction. I'd rather just read news and see news pics from around the world, and only bide my time with bouldering when I'm out at the crag.

Stretch, you're right, especially if you aren't familiar with the area. Almost all of the problems to date have required some form of cleaning. Even the established areas can seem dirty after a year or two of no ascents. A few brushes are standard issue along with shoes and chalk for me. Can't beat a day in the mtn's, cleaning/working on new problems, right?

Hopefully, some more people will get psyched to develop the area. A mini-guide should help also. My fear, though, is that even with a mini-guide, the place will be confusing. I'd bet some of the guys I've been bouldering with up there for years couldn't find their way around to all the areas! Hopefully, I can get some info out on the site and get some feedback.

when I did shut up and climb and friction, I took lots of criticism, not to put me down, but to learn what to do better next time. I think it's hard some times to separate the two. Just because we do things that are in the public eye, doesn't mean we have to treat it like an extension of our ego or self image.

There are other people that have donated thier energies into this site, and I would like to thank them for it. Jason and Kevin, for footing the costs of the site and getting things rolling. Damo has donated stacks of photos as well as writing a probe article. Louie Anderson for his write up and photos on Steele Valley. Adam Kimmerly for adding photos to the Steele Gallery. Brady Held has been working up some 3d graphics for the site. Greg Epperson has hooked us up with a gallery full of photos. Paul Dusatko also gave a bunch of photos as well as video. And many random peeps have sent in info for the lowdown and the gymscene pages. I'm sure there are even more that I can't think of right now.

well, i need help! I'm looking for anyone who knows the local areas well, and especially anyone who has recent FAs. I'm interested in doing this guide the 'right way' and making it the best climbing guidebook we've seen, but I can't do it alone so any help would be appreciated as far as route data. If you know a local area well and wanna meet up, climb, and help, just lemme know. 

I just finished Stoney Point, and am moving onto Malibu Creek. I also have to finish Old Country (Stoney Point North) so if you know that area, I could use some beta. Keep in mind that this guide only covers the bouldering at these areas.

This might be the place.  Old and I don't think it's up to Coyote standards, but we're getting there.  Price is right.  Since it's a market you can buy a 40 to wash the whole thing down.  Nice local scene/homeless dude asking for dope or change.

When you order, she is going to ask you questions in spanish.  I just nod and say Si! My burrito might have had some cooked brain, not sure, but it was tasty after a great day at tram.

The end of this burrito is spicy, all the goodness pools up in the tortilla folds and gets your nose running...score some points for that.  Did not detect any LSD in this burrito.

The real down side here is that you have to eat in the parking lot with the homeless dude (he said he used to be homeless???). Significant others of the fairer sex might not dig this hitch in the get up.

Although Rock &amp; Ice may have benefitted from acting as moral police with readers' letters, usually magazines try to be as objective as possible in the letters section.  It's important for the magazine, as well as us the readers, to keep a considerable distance between the opinions expressed in the letters section and that of the rest of the magazine (or rest of the climbing community for that matter).

no offense taken. It's a good question. 
My name is Joshua Pace, and I'm a local climber. I started writing in college, but more so in grad school where I got my MA in Linguistics. I've been hoping someone was gonna redo the old Craig Fry guide for years. Finally, I decided to look into it myself when I saw the new Bishop guidebook. I approached Wolverine about the project a couple months back and they had me do a preliminary coverage sample. I did about half of the total work for the guide and sent it to them. They loved it, said it was perfect, and gave me the contract. It just a matter of fact checking, adding recent FAs, action shots, gathering guest essays from local figures, etc. 
I'd say I'm about half way done with the entire guide; I've been working real hard to get it done quickly, but as my blog states, I want the guide to be done right, and for that to happen, it's essential to include the entire climbing community. And maybe one of the most important qualifications is that I'm definitely not doing it for the money.

I'll be out at the creek on Saturday, the 2nd if anyone wants to meet up, climb, and talk routes. Thanks!

I usually stay out of internet forums, but this is an issue that I actually care about. A few thoughts:

The Bishop guide is as good as it is because it was (literally) 10 years in the making, not to mention Wills himself climbed virtually every single problem listed. Wolverine Publishing simply put it into a neat package. It could have been laid out on Eucalyptus bark and it would have been just as good, just harder to lug around. Point being, a proper guide has far more to do with the effort put into it, than the publisher who’s paying for it.

Now I’m not a Los Angeles local, but I’ve climbed at most of the areas you’re planning to cover and I happen to know a lot about writing a guidebook. I find it astonishing that you finished a well researched and comprehensive going-over over of Stoney Point in such a short period of time. I also find it suspect that someone who is writing an LA guide needs beta on Malibu Creek. This worries me that perhaps you might not be the right person for the job [yet]. Seriously, embarking on this mission implies that you should know Malibu Creek very well from the get-go. 

Suggestions:
-Climb every problem you can. This alone requires a substantial amount of time before you’ve written anything down. Is it mandatory for a guidebook author to climb double digits? No. But it sure helps. It also helps to be able to describe/do scary problems and comment with authority.
-Tell Wolverine not to expect anything for at least a year or two. If you believe you’re sufficiently done with Stoney Point, fine, but Horse Flats alone, an area which I’ve climbed at a ton, should take 6 months to a year.

You’ve got to remember, the Fry guide hasn’t been updated not because it wasn’t needed, but because it’s a ton of work that no one has wanted to do, until now, at least. Please take the time and effort to do it right.

[b:3dzzxi2j]I agree completely. I have the utmost respect for this area and for the task of gathering info for this guidebook. I'd have to say that this is the most important thing I've ever done; I don't take it lightly.[/b:3dzzxi2j]


a proper guide has far more to do with the effort put into it, than the publisher who’s paying for it. [b:3dzzxi2j]Well said. It's for this reason that I was asked to do this project. WP has seen both my commitment and my competence in what I've done thus far.[/b:3dzzxi2j]


I find it astonishing that you finished a well researched and comprehensive going-over over of Stoney Point in such a short period of time. [b:3dzzxi2j]I guess I would too for anyone else, but I know stoney point very well, spend a lot of time there, and I know the right people. Besides, I spent 3-4 days a week there for over a month doing this work, and I'm not done. I still have to cover Old Country and a northern part of the summit boulders. more action shots too.[/b:3dzzxi2j]

Please take the time and effort to do it right.
[b:3dzzxi2j]I wouldn't think of doing anything less. There will be plenty of opportunities for everyone to see our progress and offer criticism. I want this done 'right' as much as everyone. It's because of laziness and incompetence that we have a book shelf of guides for the area and not one of them worth the $30 we paid for em... rtm's guide excluded.[/b:3dzzxi2j]

Having a degree in linguistics is an almost irrelevant qualification. A guidebook should be put together ONLY by someone who knows the bouldering as good or better than anyone else.

When I first committed myself to doing the JTree bouldering guide, I had been a hardcore jtree bouldering local for almost 15 years. And I still spent hundreds of days revisiting every area, putting my hands on virtually every problem in that book. By the time that book went to press, I had climbed over 800 of the 1000 problems listed. Tram research was done similarly, but with the help of virtually every Tram local, from both the past and the present.

I hope you understand the somewhat negative reaction here. It’s not that someone that most people don’t know is writing a guidebook (there’s a lot of climbers I don’t know), but your timeframe for this is just insane. I worked on my book for 3 years, and that’s after I had already done nearly every single problem in the guide that preceded mine. So you’re essentially getting the same story from two different angles. On one forum. From two people (rtm and myself) who don’t even know each other. This leads me to believe you are either:

a) delusional
b) plagiarizing previously printed material
c) doing a really shoddy job
d) doing a good job but have a gross interpretation of optism

If you’re doing a stand-up job, like I hope you will, the words “get it done quickly” shouldn’t even enter into the equation.

On a side note, regarding Stoney, I presume you have noted that all the new school “hard” problems were climbed by Paul Anderson years ago, forgotten about, and re-discovered when the rest of climbing finally caught up with that mutant.

Ok, I hopped on it today at lunch and it is pretty hard (Black). I tweaked it slightly (increased the size of the blue intermediate slightly, improved the pinch over the lip and added a foot hold at the lip.) and fell grabbing the top of the wall, so it is probably still in the black range. I will re-tape it if the masses deem it too hard for white. My silver X is still way harder at the finish. I will try to actually send white tomorrow at lunch.

it is common knowledge i have been working to get a good guide for LA county done for years.  craig fry and i have spoken about it over the years and he is bent over by his publisher.

AUTHORS  dont sign contracts for anything more than the print run in question.  i dont require my authors to sign everything away.  our relationship is based on our performances and our product.

AUTHORS if you are saying &quot; i dont do it for the money &quot;   you are not exploring your publishing options.

so BOB BANKS, Dimitirus, THE REST OF YOU !!!  

lets talk.  i have the capacity to product a quality guide book.  my materials if you know paper are the highest quality being used.  
i have tried to avoid 4 color because it comes from CHINA but it seems everyone gets wet over color images of rocks.

so my new guides will be in COLOR coming this year.

i just got of the phone with craig fry and i have his blessing and support.

First off, Wills' bishop guide is not the best there is...in all respect to Wills, an excellent photographer and writer/journalist, the guide has no index or  grade listing making looking up problems with only a name quite difficult if not impossible. this is a huge minus as I see it. (if I'm not mistaken the UT bouldering guide is also lacking in this, and it's an excellent book too, just poor binding) He added a downloadable index and such, which doesn't help if you don't have a computer handy. I could print it out, but isn't that's what the guide is for... Regardless, it's still first rate. 4.7832 stars outta 5.2249 stars!

Second, KD, I agree with your position primarily because you are the only one stating facts observations based on what you have discovered in conversation or other. The rest are acting like jealous moms protecting their den. If you really are protecting your den then cool, but when I think of how biased the socal scene is, how petty, and how pretentious and ego-driven many are, I find their worry over yet another guidebook to be simply retarded. I can't help but find the hollywood influence a tragic irony of actors vying for so few pennies.

It's not like the forum contributors' worries are unfounded, but stating things like &quot;you need to...,&quot; &quot;you had better...,&quot; are lame, and authoritarian too.

Rtm, how can you say that &quot;having a degree in linguistics is an almost irrelevant qualification?&quot; Maybe, maybe not, but it seems elitist to think that the a guidebook should be put together &quot;only by someone who knows the bouldering as good or better than anyone else.&quot; That happens when one goes through the process of making a guidebook. the biggest problem with &quot;knowing the problems as good or better than&quot; is that some of the info, or lots of it, take on a biased form of &quot;I know better than you, thou&quot; attitude which is just as destructive as not know it well enough. 

Personally, I would rather see someone with journalistic qualifications (Wills comes to mind), and a willingness to be as objective as possible, someone who doesn't have to put their personal tag on things to report the information, and someone who doesn't feel the need to use the book as a promotional for themselves. There's a fine line separating clarity of views and satisfying one's own ego. We're all guilty of it, but not addressing it and then making a guidebook is inexcusable, as i see it. 

Maybe the guidebook author can post or send out a pdf of a rough draft, and a &quot;committee&quot; of self-proclaimed experts can do their own personal revisions. The author can then sit down and compile this to form a new rough. Everyone gets their 2 cents worth, the author gets straight up, one on one (so to speak) input. This would require everyone to either put their 2 cents worth into work, or into a forum for critical review. Probably asking too much...

(if I'm not mistaken the UT bouldering guide is also lacking in this, and it's an excellent book too, just poor binding) He added a downloadable index and such, which doesn't help if you don't have a computer handy.

I agree with wanting it done right but it would seem like there are very few people in here who know what it takes to make a guidebook let alone a guidebook that is done &quot;right&quot;.  How many of you have climbed outside in the past week and how many of you used your guidebook? Probably not many for either. Guidebooks are for tourists and transplants. Pace I would say pay as much respect to the history and locals as you can, dust off some of the less used crags, ignore the criticism which comes across as staggering negativity in here, and talk to kevin,rtm and the locals as much as possible.

Regarding printing, folding and putting in back of book. Ok, sounds great, how about then the whole book as pdf, and we can all just print some 300 pages or whatever and fold and such? And just pay $5? I was commenting on the statement that if the guide is so great...not having an index, either by mistake or not, is still costly for the consumer. These guides are not cheap, but maybe your income prevents you from appreciating the cost?

As aggravated as some of you are, I'm led to believe that maybe I did something wrong or went about it in the wrong way. I didn't mean to offend anyone. It's quite the opposite; I've been working my ass off for this guide and I'm excited about it, and I wanted to get everyone 'onboard'. I went ahead and did some preliminary work for the publisher as a sample, and I'm here now looking for local help. People like YOU. Some of you guys, I know, but most of you, I do not.

I posted on here only to announce my plans and ask for local help. I know these areas, but I don't know them as well as some of you. I'm not as well known as some local figures, but LA is my home, and I'm damn proud to be apart of the scene. This guidebook isnt about the money or the politics. It's about creating the best fucking guidebook possible for one the best fucking climbing areas in the country. Sure, we're not Bishop or Hueco, but this is LA, and we've got some great climbing here, and the history for this area is unsurpassed.

I want to apologize for whatever I've done wrong. I didn't mean any disrespect to anyone. I guess I announced it in an abrupt manner, and my timeframe is off, I know. I know how much work is involved in getting this guide done right; it's a fucking giant. But I believe I am the most thorough person for the job. I refuse to have anything with my name on it less than perfect. That you can count on. I've put so much work into this project, months and months. There is still a lot of work to be done, and I'm here, now, asking for help. Many of you have graciously pledged your support, and I thank you. 

This is much more than a guidebook. It's something that we all can be proud of, and I want to create something that will explore in depth the history of climbing in socal and the individual areas, and I want it to be as accurate and objective as possible. The guidebook will be comprehensive, accurate and intuitive. I'm the right person for the job. I invite any and everyone to meetup with me, climb, and talk about this guide before I move forward with any more work.

Probably, we all say things on here that we wouldnt say face to face. It's the nature of the internet. The guide book that i am proposing and have put a lot of work into already is a Los Angeles County Bouldering Guide. If you go to my blog over at socalbouldering.blogspot.com it may help give you a better idea of what I have in mind. However, keep in mind that this is only a proposed set of criteria.
I also share a strong desire to include as much history as possible in the guide. These are the kind of things we can talk about. So let's all slow down a little, meetup, and go from there. I'm free all next week. I'll be over at Stoney on Tuesday as usual.

Seems to be a particularly touchy subject here.

My opinion:

Guidebooks (at least those done well) are a lot of work.  They should be accurately researched (big time involved here), historically relevant (learn the history, get to know the locals, experience and include the local color, etc.), be easy to use (multiple maps, layers, indexes, etc.), and get climbers psyched to visit the areas (quality action photos of as many different climbers as possible - hopefully those that are involved with the areas being depicted).

Perhaps the best person to do a project like this would be someone involved in the development of the areas being featured, but since this book will cover a broad range of areas that might be too much to ask for.

Next best option would be a compilation of info from many active locals.  This would require someone to be the actual editor, compiler, author or whatever else you want to call it.  Seems like this is more or less what Josh is proposing.

I can think of a handful of obvious candidates (other than Josh) to take on this project, but if I'm honest I would have to admit that they are candidates in my mind because of their historical involvement with the areas or because they are people that have had an impact in my experiences with those areas.  I can’t speak to their interest in producing a book or possible skill in doing one.  Would they necessarily do a better job?  Maybe, but I don't really know.

When it comes right down to it, anyone could write this book.  But for that to happen they would have to put the time in to do what's been suggested above by Robert, Kevin, and many others.  Visit all of the areas.  Climb as many of the problems as possible and attempt the others.  Talk to EVERYONE you can about EVERY problem and EVERY area.  Take or purchase quality action and area photos.  Study the history involved and report it accurately and completely.  And above all else, don't cut corners (quality or time spent) and care passionately about the final product.

Regardless of who is involved in this, I hope that person follows these guidelines.

I (as I'm sure are many others) am looking forward to see what becomes of this.  Hopefully there will be a quality guide at the end of the process.";;"0";"gA==";"2bpyb42y";"1";"0";;"16";"0";"0"

I find it a bit weird that when someone, including myself, comments on your website, you go ballistic. Then when someone wants to do a guidebook to areas you are not very familiar with, you go ballistic on them for nothing more than being presumptuous about their intent. You say things like &quot;he deserves it.&quot;  You use this forum and the website to personally lash out at anyone who disagrees.

ps. I have no problem making comments about work that is public. That includes your guidebook or this website or comments made by anyone. I would like to keep such comments to the topic or reactions at hand. Nevertheless, this isn't always the case, and those that are guilty know it, including myself. If this bothers you, which it certainly seems to, then you are just going to have to deal with it. I don't like it when a bunch of guys gang up and start talking shit without any foundation, and that includes you and your response to josh. If there was something he said that bothered your then I would think a simple response by asking or commenting might be in order, but talking shit and trying to belittle someone is simply inappropriate, and this is what I see over and over. I will chime in every time you or someone else does that without foundation, as I see it.

For treating me like an adult. I know that posts are interpreted differently by each person that reads them, I don’t feel like I am lashing out when I write them. If I don’t receive criticism from you well, it’s because of the way you present it to me, it seems a bit callous and impersonal for a friend. 

I regret that it ended up seeming like we ganged up on him. His original comments set a different tone for the topic. When he made the guide comment, yea I took it personally, not because he may think that my guides suck, but because he was insulting people, some that are friends of mine, and all of the hard work that they did to make their guides.

 If I was self serving with this site, I would have ditched this thread as soon as it came up. I actually think that this is awesome that this has gone down here. Look how stimulating his same topic is over at RC.com. This proves that the community IS out there, and they are speaking up more and more on this site. 

The main point (I thought) I was making was that he needs to involve the local bouldering community as much as possible. And it looks like he’s more up to doing to that now.";;"0";"kA==";"13rfly95";"1";"0";;"3";"0";"0"

I don't recall that he insulted anyone. He came out speaking with a super psyched attitude because he was passionate about doing it. That's what I read... 

You know what I think about all the hard work you guys put into your guidebooks? I think you and the others did it because you guys wanted to, or am I mistaken. 

This is what I saw: 
[b:1kppsf3n]first assumption[/b:1kppsf3n] was he is hasty, almost done with the guidebook, and wants some cursory info and/or tacit approval from the forum community.
[b:1kppsf3n]second assumption[/b:1kppsf3n] was you guys who do guidebooks put tons of work into them and they take x number of years to complete therefore he must do the same
[b:1kppsf3n]third assumtion[/b:1kppsf3n] since he isn't he must be an idiot therefor you all are justified

I hate to say this but this is the thinking that gets people lynched. 

This was about his idea and his effort to connect to people who have lots to say about doing a guidebook. Each person that came down hard made a point about their authority and their stake in something they weren't doing. You guys acted as if the entire community of boulderers is, well, you guys. It isn't.

Personally, I find this thread neither stimulating in a positive way nor proof of anything healthy, other than that it's an example of what not to do next time. 

If he wasn't up to getting the community involved then why did he post originally? You act as if you got him to turn around and involve you and others. He made the effort initially... and I don't think it's cool to take that away from him. 

I think some of the things he said and in the context he said them, like mentioning his academic credentials came off to you guys as strutting or showing off. Maybe it was a bit, but I also thought it was important to know. At least he can probably write and think and work hard on a project. 

I want you to know that I do respect the hard work you put into the things you have done in climbing. I remember (I hope you don't mind my mentioning this) that when you embarked on the josh guidebook, you knew almost nothing about photography, graphic design, and how to go about even starting the project. Yet you were super psyched, and have probably logged more footsteps to more shrinking boulders then anyone alive. And, as time has proven, you rose to the task and did a bang up job, first rate. But that doesn't mean there isn't any room for critique. In fact with the possibility of future updates, why wouldn't you want input as you so eloquently stated josh needs input... What I think is most incredible about your 2 guidebooks is trying to deal with all the factions, personalities and disparate attitudes that is so cal bouldering. Dealing with FA information for the tram was a joke, so to speak, and you handled it with aplomb.

He came in here trying to convince us that his guide was going to be the best guide ever, and we were telling him what we though something like that would entail. 

I may have been wrong to make assumptions about his project, but this is what let to them initially. My first doubt came as nobody seemed to know who this guy was. Now I know that I don’t know everybody out there, but I do know a few prominent locals in that area, one in particular was working towards that very same goal. Continuing to sway my opinion negatively was that he was implying that he was finishing up! I did not see how someone could have gotten that far along without, at some point, having some interaction with these people. Unless he knows the areas as good as anyone out there… The mystery remains as to how he got info for (his estimate) 1700 problems?? Without having a hella lotta contact with many different locals. I think it’s that question that got everyone riled the most.

As I said above, I'd like to see the guide produced and done well.  Josh seems motivated and if he can pull it off - more power to him.  

Regardless of who authors this thing, the entire local community benefits from having a nice guide or suffers from having a worthless volume.  Everyone should pitch in to make this thing as good as it can be.  Maybe everyone doesn't know Josh, but it seems to me like he's trying to get to know the portions of the community he hasn't come in contact with.  He's also asking for the community's input and consensus.  I fail to see how either of those efforts could be seen as being wrong.

&quot;no!  this is your last climbing trip before the baby comes!  plus, you already paid for the campsite.  suck it up and climb!&quot;

around 10pm the winds started.  my tent was on a bed of rock, so i neglected to spike it down.  the rocks on the corners didn't help, and around 11pm, my tent collapsed.i struggled to get out of my sleeping bag and put on my jacket.  i piled all my belongings into the back of my tiny car, laid down the seat, and contorted my body enough to lay down and sleep.  the car rocked back and forth in the wind for the rest of the night.

at 7am, i woke up.  the wind was still howling and the clouds were rolling in from the west.  i sat in the back of my car trying to think of a sheltered place to climb.  i drove out to Hall of Horrors, walked around, and decided to call it a day.  i left the park, experienced the worst ever customer service at the Denny's in Yucca Valley, and started down towards the 10.

The rain was pouring, and I could barely see 50 yards ahead.  I was doing fine, trying to stay focused on the dashed white lines flying by.  10-east, just before california st. in Redlands, i hydroplaned.  i did about 2 360's, bounced off the center divide, did 2 more 360's and slammed head-first into the center divide.  my car was totaled, i was shaking uncontrollably, and somehow my Joshua Tree park pass had jumped from my center console to the side pocket of the drivers side door (amazing physics).  

no car rental places are open in this great city of Redlands.  so now i'm sitting in the lobby of a Howard Johnson below the freeway, waiting for my father in law to drive up from San Diego and pick me up.  he'll drive me to SD where my wife is this weekend, then we'll make the 2 hour drive back to LA tonight.

sucks.

lesson learned: if you already had a great day of bouldering, and the next day it will probably rain, and you're alone, hungry, and only 2 hours from a warm bed and hot food...go, man.  just go.

ok. that could be. I haven't done it for a few months, so that wouldn't surprise me, considering all the breaking that's going on over there (people need to let it dry!). I'll check it out. btw, I'd say the &quot;new&quot; Masters of Reality is just as good as the original. Checked it out last Thursday. I agree that it still goes about V5. Old problem was maybe a bit soft for the grade.

The two problems back there are Vaino and Johnson arete (not the Johnson Problem). I've always thought that Vaino (left problem) standing start goes at about V4, and figured the sit would go around V8 (haven't done).

For my money, the Johnson Arete (right problem) is one of the coolest lines at Stoney, but is maybe V5ish?

If that's true, then Soul Cal's definitely to blame for that one.  because of the Urban Rock error and the fact that the Fry guide only lists Johnson's, I deferred to that &quot;film&quot; for the names and ratings.

So surprising that there are so many errors/mistakes on names/grades at Stoney.  getting kind of sick of it, frankly.

Yeah, you're right - my bad. My apologies to mr. diddy. I must have been thinking of another problem that got upgraded because it was in a video.

As for the sit to Vaino, I'm only guessing on the V8 grade based on a few goes and maybe also on trying to find a V8 line back there that would make the guide make more sense. I think most of the stuff at Stoney is pretty solid, just a few little spots like this where I have questions. Personally, I love the place - graffiti, glass and all! Just having a little fun debating some cool problems.

yeah, i saw some chalk on the sit of Vaino...didn't bother Sunday.  I'll try to take a look the next time I'm over there.  There's a line on the NW corner of the boulder (right of Johnson).  Any idea what that is?

Since I had the old Craig Fry guide out, I noticed some big discrepancies between that and the Urban Rock guide on the B1 boulder. All those problems are definitely old enough to be right in both guides. It's too bad that guides come out with misinformation, especially on such classic boulders as B1. Hopefully the upcoming guide will be well researched and get it all right. If I were making that guide, I'd go to great lengths to have a good history of several boulders at Stoney (B1, Turlock, Boulder One) accompanying the problem pictures/descriptions. This would be especially helpful for documenting the evolution of problems that have changed over the years.";;"0";"gA==";"b0spv858";"1";"0";;"17";"0";"0"

First off, let me put the rumor about Powerglide to rest - no holds have broken; it's still the same problem it was the first time I saw it back in 2000. In my opinion, it's the area standard for V6.

Now, as for the back of Split Rock, that's a different ball game. I don't consider myself an authority on the place by any means, but here's my take on those problems... 

Left-most problem goes about V4, with right hand on the arete, left on crimp about face height. Set feet, bump left up to good sloper on the lip, etc.... I've always thought this was Vaino Problem, but not so sure looking a both guides.

The other arete, just right of that one, feels maybe V5 for a tall guy like me. It is the best of the lines I have done back there, and I believe it is the Johnson Arete. It starts low, left hand on the arete and right hand in a hole on the face. Move up using arete and crimps/sidepulls on face. 

I did Valdez today, seems like an easy V1. The low left hand ball has broken, but everything else is good. 

I'd guess the arete between Johnson Arete and Valdez goes as well, but I haven't tried. Interestingly, the Craig Fry guide has this line listed as &quot;Vain Problem&quot;, B1. (It doesn't show anything as &quot;Vaino&quot;, so maybe this line is the Vaino Problem?

It is a little remarkable that there could be so much confusion over these problems after all these years, but I'd say that because they are off the beaten path and there are discrepancies in the guidebooks it is understandable.

There are a handful of people who could set it straight, so I'll be checking around in the coming weeks if no one posts an explanation. Maybe jspace has that area sussed out for his guide? Dimitrius, you know?

Oh yeah, Dimitrius, if you mean a direct line topping out Mosaic Thump, nice! I didn't see any chalk up top, but with the rain lately that's no surprise. Is that the line you're talking about?

I thought for sure that it had gone before. Any takers? Maybe this is the one that Dimitri is referring to... but there are direct lines for all the routes on the wall there. and on top of that, all the routes have been linked up so there are quite a few climbs available on the wall. As for Split Rocks, I've got a sit start for both Vaino and Johnson Arete. There are a number of variations between the two. I think since there is a bit of confusion on the ratings of Johnson Arete and Powerglide, it'd be interesting to get a consensus on the two.

so far, 1 vote for 
v6 for Powerglide 
v5 for the johnson arete

i, myself, would put put the arete at around v5/6, def not v8 as it is in the guide. but i agree, its a great line.

If this guy &quot;jynckx&quot;, is out there, I appreciate your creativity with the routes here. I've added most of these variations in the guide, but come on! v10? and 3 of em... Yeah, I don't think so. If someone has the FA, they are entitled to name the route, but what's with all the lion names? It's all based upon the assumption that this boulder is called &quot;The Lion Boulder,&quot; which is not the case. I'd be interested in some discussion on the ratings for these lines and maybe some new names??

While the handful of people on this forum who go to Stoney find this thread, I'm curious to get your take on the Johnson Arete area. Aside from the two main lines we've been talking about, what else back there do you have for your guide? Also, what sources have you found for that area? (I'm guessing the previous guides, but any uber-locals or old-timers?) I only ask to see if I can learn more about what the original lines are. IMO, the Fry guide seems to be a better resource for that spot, and it has a different take than the Owen guide. Obviously, there are sit starts to all the lines back there; I'm mainly curious about the main lines. 

As for the stuff from jynckx, all I can say is &quot;wow&quot;. That page is pretty far out there. I love that he just changed the name of a boulder at Stoney! Great stuff. As with anything &quot;new&quot; at Stoney, I'd be extremely cautious to publish without a good consensus, like you're doing.

On that note, here's another forum question for debate: Does starting one established problem, hitting part of an established traverse, and finishing up another established problem make a &quot;new&quot; problem? I can see where this is fun, and in some cases actually flows well (like Titty F^^k), but on this boulder, isn't that a bit overkill? All interesting variations, but I don't see something like the Standard Route traversing into the Tree route and topping out as an independent line. Just my opinion.

I understand that problems can get contrived by creating GYM rules or eliminates, however there are areas such as Morrison CO or the Ice Caves in Bishop, that have been full developed in this fashion. I think the consensus of the bouldering community is that Morrison is not contrived, but a small crag that some locals did everything they could to keep it interesting. I would say the Ice Cave is contrived because someone tried to force lines into a much larger crag when only one real line existed. The only issue I have found with these types of areas is if you are no with a local figuring out these line with any type of description is almost impossible. 

I remember the first time I went to the Ice Caves, I just walked out  and left due to the difficulty of finding a distinct line. My point is not that I think this is a good practice, but an established practice.

For SoCal, this is especially the case at Stoney, where there are several boulders that lend themselves to lots of variations and link-ups (Boulder 1, B1, and Turlock, mainly). My only thought was that in this particular case, linking one problem to another isn't really creating any new or different climbing move - it's just a link-up. The thing that makes some variations cool is the fact that you have to figure out a new way to get from point A to point B. But I guess Stoney Point is fairly similar to a big outdoor gym anyway, so what's the harm in adding more to the guide? (By the way, I for one am excited to see the new guide when you're done, Josh. I hope it turns out well!)

I'd planned on adding some of Mr. jynckx's contributions because of the fullness it adds to the park. As the guidebook goes, it gives the climber more 'routes' to 'tick' off the list and project. For example, maybe someone has done Powerglide and Mosaic Thump, but starting at MT, traversing from the mid-wall jug to finish at PG is a good bit harder.
It's a valid and important point that these additions aren't really new routes, but how do we 'talk' about em? Some link-ups are worth adding to a guide, some are not. It seems as though the norm is to treat some link-ups as individual routes with independent ratings such as some of the cave routes done over in Hollow Mountain Cave, some recent Andrada sends, and [url=http&#58;//www&#46;climbing&#46;com/news/hotflashes/robinsonterremerv15/:3jifryiu]this[/url:3jifryiu]. 

As for the backside of Split Rocks, I've used all the old guides for reference, but I've talked with a few locals about the area. Mike Waugh has been very helpful, and I met another long-time local who gave me some specific info on the arete, but I can't remember his name. I wasn't working on the guidebook at that time so I wasn't taking names. Kinda reminded me of William Dafoe, said he was friends with Reardon and Johnson. Another guy that has been real helpful with some recent FAs is a guy named Yair.
From left to right, I have Vaino Problem with 3 variations. one comes from the left, one is a low start, and the other is standing. for the right side split, there is johnson arete proper, a sit start, and a variation that climbs the middle face without using the edge holds. i havent really looked at this middle one, it was mentioned that it has been done before. ill look into it. then there is the right edge and some various face routes to the right of it. i dont have my work in front of me so im just going off memory, besides im not done with the area. i still need to meet with the locals and talk about our plans. Kevin Daniels is in progress of setting up a meeting.

I agree. That one is def contrived and I don't plan to add it to the guide. Its just a little too contrived. I think one good principle to follow in the guide is that if two independent lines aren't really all that great per se, then putting them together isn't going to create much novelty. I like The Standard. I think it's great route, but in that example he's just starting at the standing start jug for The Standard and moving right to The Tree route. Not much there, imho.

The gym serves as a place to train. Due to the fixed nature of the gym sometimes one must create rules (no huecos, tracking only, arete off, etc) to capture certain movement.

I have found that my most enjoyable experiences have come predominately from problems that have few or no stars on them. 

Take sherman's classic hueco guide where more stars usually means high balls. Seriously, how many people climb high balls? I see a similar penchant for this type of interpretation showing up in other guidebooks as well. Problems I find enjoyable have come from time spent with certain people, moves climbed, and the overall experience I felt after the day was done. 

I've tried to spend days where I focus on climbing at a new crag solely by stars, basically racking up high numbers of them, regardless of grade, and didn't necessarily feel like it was so fun. Contrast that will days where I hardly did anything but had a first rate experience with the crew present. 

In retrospect, I'm beginning to feel like authors, and nothing against any one in particular, feel a need to tell others what is meaningful and important, yet, when the day is done, the only thing meaningful and important has nothing to do with anyone's opinion but the time spent... As an example, as nice as doing Planet X is, in retrospect, it's more enjoyable to look at and talk about and admire BECAUSE it carries 5 stars then it ever was climbing. The crimp moves to the dyno are not especially that exciting (the best technical moves are doing the slab off the ground without a cheatstone), the dyno is, well, a dyno that once done is not exactly very special, and the topout is basically pulling on a classic grainy sloping crimp and standing out of a jug foot to the top. I'm not trying to belittle it; it is a classic problem, but, it often gets done by one person, and everyone else looks on in admiration or something... I then walk around to Jerry's Kids or the slabs in the corridor behind JK and work the line(s) with my friends, and after all is said and done, we walk away, maybe with one or multiple ascents, and truly felt like it was a worthy experience for all. The moves are straight up cool, nothing is a gimme, it's easier, and more profound to contemplate in retrospect.

I'm curious if anyone else feels their experiences are better served with doing starred problems or just going out and climbing/bouldering. Do you really need someone to tell you that 45 Degree Wall at hueco is 5 stars? I think we are all capable of that judgment for ourselves. Are guidebook authors really beholden to some special sense of value judgment that we, as visitors, are not?

I think this practice is way over rated and could be axed, along with first ascent info, without reducing anyone's experiences. I also feel that star ratings can easily be abused, steering people away from good lines, and towards areas the author deems important. As an alternative, maybe by using more descriptive verbiage, the author can convey an experience that might suit an interested party without resorting to labels. Or maybe there should only be a one star rating... it's either worth doing or maybe not, and let the practitioner be the judge of more stars. 

AGAIN&lt; nothing negative is implied towards any guidebook authors... this is a topic that is pervasive in guidebooks, and so it's a topic open to all.

it was also a sliding scale based on current standards keeping &quot;values&quot; out of the equation and direction and discovery relevant. 

sherman's scale creates too much of a connection, either intended or unintended, between the FA's and his/her &quot;achievement&quot; resulting in more ego support and less as a guide tool.

More or less I agree with you.  Not to name names but it seems that many of the guidebooks out there have star ratings based on the author's projects/FAs/fav problems/style etc.  However, ideally I think they serve another purpose which may be lost on the glitz of the actual object being a star - that is, they point out the most popular and classic lines of the area.  Or at least they should.  Like fraction said, for a quick tour, star ratings [i:3021ocdc]should[/i:3021ocdc] point to the climbs most people deem as area classics.  This really gets down to guide research and being objective as possible...and we've been there done that, see other thread.

I'd like the stars to be replaced with another rating system such as degree of high traffic or how classic a problem is.  (Even how classic a problem is, as stated, is subjective however).  I don't hate the star system and generally feel better about sending something deemed as an area classic, than a no-star problem, but still it seems that the justification for the star rating or lack thereof is not always there.  

To date, I think the Bishop guide's star ratings are the most accurate in terms of classic nature of the problems and high traffic climbs.  I don't know the authors well enough to say that their personal opinions have or have not influenced the star ratings but it seems that high traffic climbs or climbs that most people consider to be classic have the appropriate amount of stars.";;"0";"IA==";"3021ocdc";"1";"0";;"24";"0";"0"

for josh, I can see categorizing because it's more informational, and less subjective. in other words, to use maybe a graininess symbol for problems that are, well, grainy would be very helpful. I don't think that graininess is bad, just important to know. I would also like to see anything over a set height listed not as a high ball but with measured feet like Mari used in her josh guidebook.

This type of info adds quite a bit of work for the author, but it also adds quite a bit to the practitioner's experience. 

I think information is always more important than a generalized subjective rating. Said info would give the reader the power to judge for themselves what is deemed important. 

To clarify... I was being subjective and that was my point. Thanks for clarifying that... I did a 3 move grainfest problem near JBMFP that I enjoyed more that PX. But should I give it 5 stars and PX 3? Of course not! 

I say empower the practitioner. Subjectivity is like traffic lights subliminally guiding the horde to certain areas. It's a form of supervision... The park service is an expert in &quot;guiding&quot; people to certain places, and telling them what the park service wants them to know, and, at the same time, steering them clear of areas they don't want people to go to. an example is putting a sign up in front of a yucca and saying it's a yucca. Um... couldn't then just show a picture and say go find one? But at the same time, I support their efforts to assist the handicapped, but the line has to be drawn at some point. Considering how much we spend on defense (in excess of 700 B), those with handicaps could ask for assistance and park rangers, instead of being cops, could actually give those with limitations personal tours. I'd feel good about my tax dollars supporting that instead of more cluster bombs for the israeli defense forces. 

Is graininess really subjective? Alexandria is almost completely void of graininess, but the Angry Pacific is from bottom to almost top. AP was more enjoyable my myself, but A was a first rate problem. My point is that both require quite a bit of walking to get to... so it would hurt but to alert them of this bit of info. Also, AP is dangerous. A is not, in fact it's not really a highball whose height defies this point. I see it as information... and let the reader decide. Also, I would only apply it to those problems that are obvious. the truth is it's just an idea. The bishop guide uses quite a few symbols to define the character of a line. If I'm not mistaken, so is the new hueco guide...

I can agree to those terms and your example.  Before you posted that I guess I was concerned with the amount of actual beta a guide gives.  That can be a slippery slope and it seems that sometimes guides practically tell you what sequences work best.  With that said, I've been upset with the lack of information (especially starting holds as mentioned) for problems that may not have high star ratings.  

Also, in terms of the grainy symbol, wouldn't this go away after lots of traffic?  Could that be why this type of thing is left out?";;"0";"gA==";"30rvtidz";"1";"0";;"24";"0";"0"

Sure, some rock is total choss like the start of the peanut, but choss is a subjective description that means, to me, &quot;I don't want to tackle the extra effort of establishing contact...&quot; and the peanut would definitely be a good example of that. I also know I'm in the minority on this. But the rest of the peanut is pretty standard grainy rock that still climbs well, albeit with extra caution and attention to solid contact.

In a recent discussion with Wills on high ball grainy lines, we both admitted there is a certain bit of adventure and thrill to doing lines that require extra attention and caution. And, we both accepted it's not by any means normal. My point is that by calling something choss could prevent anyone from attempting the climb and miss out on a special experience. Josh runs the full gambit of rock character and to discredit a line because it's choss, or loose or whatever discounts a large number of climbs. 

I agree people should know what type or nature the rock is, and this is very applicable to josh, but it's not like josh rock doesn't clean up after repeat ascents. Furthermore, blacks and tram both have loose crap that cleans up over time, mostly. Even font is known for having to clean extensively for first ascents, ditto for squamish. I personally don't like to pigeon-hole rock into thinking it has to be of a certain nature. If grainy rock is considered &quot;bad&quot; then planet x needs a reduction in perceived quality since the top out is so-called &quot;choss (ie. grainy).&quot; I can list quite a few lines of high star rating if &quot;choss&quot; is relevant. 

Seriously, I can't argue that lines like alexandria are sweet, but that's, by far the exception in josh. What about Bittersweet? Most of it is solid except, again, the topout... but the topout is the business and why it's not only called that but why it stings if you mess up. 

Blacks is a good example of what one can call relative choss, since footholds are almost nonexistent, even the slightest bit of flakiness constitutes poor quality. Again...it's all subjective. Another example is Slashface...the crux isn't what i would call high quality in a conventional sense or by hueco standards, yet it gets 5 stars. Also, the climb has cleaned up over time. 

Golfer, if you start by creating a new rating system on rock quality, you add yet another subjective pov based on someone's opinion of what choss is. I was hoping that by using a grainy icon, one adds information without getting too subjective. for me graininess is quintessential joshua tree. do you really think Newton's Law is that good? The top is grainy rock that looks to have cleaned up over time. With your rating, at it's inception as a problem, it could have had a much lower rating...but now it's decent. If it's classified as grainy, I think it would tend to stand the test of time without getting too subjective because it is and remains grainy...it's nature.

The good part is that you usually find something else in that area that is really good.  Everything is perspective, but from my perspective if the author is going to hike all over BFE, research and attempt the majority of problems in the guide, and spend countless hours listening to everyone's bullshit opinions on ratings and star ratings he or she should be able to give whatever star ratings they feel apply.  It is definately harder to give star ratings in newer areas than in areas like Josh or Yosemite where history has pretty much established the classics.  I think the work any guidebook author such as Wills, Louie, or RTM puts in entitles them to an opinion about the star quality of the problems in their guide.

Though, yes, if we sounded off on that thread, it would help improve such a list, but it's the very list I'm arguing against. 

If you feel entitlement is important... then I take that as your position and that star ratings are just that...important. My point is that maybe this so called tried and true entitlement concept is simply very misguided and unnecessary. But hey, you're right in that if they feel entitled, then go ahead--while on the flip side one is always wondering why in the hell some choss pile gets so many stars and a super classic tech problem gets none. 

So why not just let the climber decide and give the climber as much info as possible? I guess that's a bit in the face of entitlement.

What I'm getting from your perspective is if so and so is going to hike all over BFE, and so forth they should be allowed to do whatever they want. I guess in so doing, if they do a shitty job, we are stuck with their guide and simply choose not to buy it. Ok. Of course that begs the question then why would we or they want any input. Let them do as they please and let the market dictate the outcome. I guess some of us want to support the collective and attempt to improve the guidebook such that we won't get a guide like the BS one covering the tram before the comprehensive tram guide came out. And wasn't that the whole point of going off on Joshua's parade concerning his efforts to do a socal guide for LA county? Certainly that energy was a bit misguided and overwrought but well-intentioned nonetheless. 

I think the point is to offer input and discussion on ideas, and this shouldn't be a problem, at least for some. RTM can choose what is pertinent and take what he needs, and that is all I want to accomplish. I could just talk to him in person, but I think there is nothing wrong with allowing others to here the ideas and offer up their input--which includes yours.

I was suggesting a different approach to authoring a guidebook in that the book should be focused on information and data rather than opinions. 

So much is included in the star rating that many fine lines become trivialized by the star rating. Historical significance, quality of rock, height, quality of line, and more are all wrapped up in a single star rating without actually giving the climber anything substantive. I'm only suggesting relying on using icons and written information to allow the climber to pick and choose what they want to do without getting too opinionated. 

As an example, there is a 2 star problem right next to yard arm that is total crap, yet lines like newton's law have one star. NL is so much characteristic of josh climbing, and that other line whose name escapes me is like a lame gym problem on poor rock, not grainy but straight up poor rock. I realize this is opinionated, but my point is the star rating implies something that can be argued counter to the implication.

As much as the author is entitled, doesn't the buyer of a very expensive book have any say? But it's not like he/she can choose between 2 or 3 versions... guidebook authors have a captured audience where the marketplace is seriously skewed in favor of the author and publisher.

Sure, some rock is total choss like the start of the peanut, [b:3ayi3sgm]but choss is a subjective description[/b:3ayi3sgm] that means, to me, &quot;I don't want to tackle the extra effort of establishing contact...&quot; and the peanut would definitely be a good example of that. I also know I'm in the minority on this. But the rest of the peanut is pretty standard grainy rock that still climbs well, albeit with extra caution and attention to solid contact.

Blacks is a good example of what one can call relative choss, since footholds are almost nonexistent, even the slightest bit of flakiness constitutes poor quality. [b:3ayi3sgm]Again...it's all subjective.[/b:3ayi3sgm] Another example is Slashface...the crux isn't what i would call high quality in a conventional sense or by hueco standards, yet it gets 5 stars. Also, [b:3ayi3sgm]the climb has cleaned up over time. [/b:3ayi3sgm][/quote:3ayi3sgm]

Say what now?  I thought you were saying that grainiess/chossiness is not really subjective....grrr...I don't even care anymore.  

[quote=&quot;SupaFreaky&quot;:3ayi3sgm]I am only suggesting that the author be entitled to his or her opinion.  We all have our personal favorite problems, and know how many satrs we think they deserve.  I completely agree that Planet X is not a 5 star problem, but if RTM thinks so let him give the thing as many stars as he wants.  Personally I erased 3 of those stars in my guide.  I am not trying to say that guidebook authors are the only ones entitled to opions, but shouldn't all their hard work at least entitle them to that.  Personally I favor the no guidebook approach.  Just climb what looks good to you regardless of rating or stars.  I spent years climbing at the Buttermiks with no guide, and didn't really need anyone to tell me what the most classic problems were at the time.  It was pretty obvious.[/quote:3ayi3sgm]

Supa, gotta say I disagree with you here.  Unless the author wants to only use his guide book for his personal use or for a few of his likewised robot friends, I don't see how having his opinion within the star ratings does the public any service.  If he wants to tell us about his personal favorites maybe he can list that in the foreword or the 'about the author' section.  

While I think the star rating is a noble idea (good natured in that it's supposed to lead us to classic or historic high traffic areas) I think that the goal of the star rating is lost, as satyagraha so eloquenty stated.  The more I think about this, the more I realize how little I rely completely on star ratings.  I rely much more on word of mouth to determine whether a line is classic before trying it.  In fact, of the last four guides I bought, I generally flip through them the first day and look at the area classics and them mumble things under my breath like, &quot;WTF? How is that a classic?&quot; or &quot;1 star my ass!  That thing is one of the best problems I've done!&quot;  

And that's really what I think star rating should be, the general public opinion of a climb based on history, classic nature, and high traffic.  Take the Cube at the Tram.  I fuggin' hate that problem!  But it got 3 stars and I agree with that because it's so high trafficked, sought after, talked about etc.  I can't say for certain that RTM's personal opinion of the problem didn't overrule any public opinion but nonetheless it's an example of when I think even if I don't like the problem, that the star rating was accurate.  As stated by others though, maybe the actual star usage is not the best system and I like Satya's idea of icons.  There was a rockfax guide to Bishop that had even more icons then the Wolverine guide.  They put things like reachiness, highball, uneven landing...etc.";;"0";"wA==";"3ayi3sgm";"1";"0";;"24";"0";"0"

I'd like to chime in a little with some quick opinions. I'd only give my post 1 star, though, so skip ahead if you're looking for a classic, 5 star post. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) --> 

Star ratings are obviously the opinion of the author. Understood. They do, however, once published, seem to become part of the identity of the problem. This is the downside, IMO.

Another thought: generally, the latest, hardest lines get a higher star rating, which is ridiculous, if you think about it.

Also, highballs also tend to attract more stars. I guess there are more good moves 15+ feet above the ground.

If I ever get that miniguide to Holcomb out, I'm leaning toward a 1 star system, but that's partly because I don't want it to be a huge book that costs $40. I also think that adding a user input section to websites like socalbouldering where people are encouraged to list their personal top 10 list for individual areas would be a fun way for everyone to give a little of their opinions as well. This is no different than banter at the crag, but opens the discussion up to a wider community. Users could then update them as their opinions change (the problem I see with this would be that everyone loves their latest project!).";;"0";"wA==";"2o5s7b0b";"1";"0";;"17";"0";"0"

Earlier in the post, fraction and I tossed the idea of having a one star or similar idea that would focus on something the author thought was worth noting without opining to the extreme. 

Stretch... I see your point and will try and clarify: 

I speak of graininess as a term no different then say smoothness, or flakiness without getting into &quot;levels of...&quot; meaning if you ever climbed at josh, you would quickly recognize that small bits of grain end up imbedded in your rubber sole, in your fingers and palms. So that is my point that graininess can be more a reference for a condition without getting into how bad or not bad it is. (first boldened point)

Regarding choss, the term has carried such a negative connotation that something that's described as choss is usually undesireable and subsequently avoided. I wanted to differentiate between grain being a state or condition and choss being a judgement of that state or condition. I guess one can argue that grain is also subjective, but then one can also argue that the sky is blue is equally subjective, and it would be since blue is a specific color with a specific hue and the sky might actually not be that--hence it can be all subjective.  (second boldened point)

I'm not sure of your third boldened point since it's just an observation I've made about josh rock loosing a fair bit of graininess with traffic/time. 

I don't understand why you don't care; is it you simply can't tolerate mistakes or mispeaks in written communication. I'm not perfect; in fact, I'm a photographer, but at the same time I can't excuse my errors or confusing verbiage. 

Feel free to offer up a new thought, I'd like to be the critic for a change...

Thanks for the clarification.  Not that I really don't care, just that this is getting a bit technical for my taste.  I know I know...I'm part of the problem.

Actually I like the consensus idea that brian had.  I'm not sure about the actual logistics, but it does seem we're talking ideals here and you'd want a way for everyone to weigh in with their &quot;star&quot; ratings.  As much as 8a is an ego fest, I do like that you can put your own star ratings and comments  on each problem and then look at other people's comments as well.  And you can even log different grades for problems than most people and see the corresponding differences.  We (read: mostly me <!-- s:oops: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Embarassed\" /><!-- s:oops: -->) keep talking about subjectivity and trying to avoid it, but maybe we should embrace it and not even try to be objective, just as long as it's not only one person's opinion being heard.  

On somewhat of a sidenote I was just looking for my next Netflix movie and took a note of their star ratings.  They have a basic five star rating system based on (I think) other customer ratings.  And while it's quite advanced and probably will never happen on a bouldering website, you can even rate movies you've seen and based on that star rating it will give you suggestions of other movie you might like.  Seriously, isn't that great?!  I always wanted to live my life based on what a computer deems appropriate for me!  <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P -->  But I digress...";;"0";"wA==";"185u6itv";"1";"0";;"24";"0";"0"

I agree about netflix, and subjectivity based on user/consumer input is a good idea. It becomes very democratic in nature. You simply can't argue with it. Your opinion might be different, but it truly becomes just yours. 

I stand corrected on the graininess icon and the problem cleaning up. But the reality is, it's really only the holds that tend to clean up. And if the problem isn't done often, the graininess tends to remain or reemerge.

Well when you word it like that then I don't think anybody has a problem.  However, coming to a consensus isn't the same as putting the author's opinion as the star rating, and that's what we were talking about.  With that said, from what I know about the areas (which I never claimed to be much) I think RTM has done a great job juggling all the loads of opinions on the areas into nice star ratings that we are free to disregard or use religiously.";;"0";"wA==";"24gme6z9";"1";"0";;"24";"0";"0"

When I go to, say, the Brickyard, I like to have the guide with me because I'm not as familiar.

i know this question is late in the day, but i hope someone can answer before we leave in the AM:

is there any bouldering *within walking distance* of belle campground?  we might stay there, and i'd like to get out for some night bouldering.  i think the 2.5 miles to Alexandria may be a bit much...i can see some formations south of the campground (google earth), but no mention i the Josh bouldering guide.

big wedge is almost a 2 mile walk in the dark, and not much for screwing around in the dark.  the n00bs will not enjoy the overhanging v5 hand crack.

Maybe I just forgot to put the &quot;R&quot; on Lotus Flower. Psyche is one of the few times that I sprained my ankle bouldering. And I did it several times on that very problem. 

Given the height of the problem, the steepness, and the commiting nature of the finish move. I think its more dangerous than something like slashface or alexandria, which are basically jug hauls to the top.

[u:8wsqq5oh]All About RSS[/u:8wsqq5oh]

Why does RSS rock?  

problem/solution:

problem:
in order to know if any of my favorite websites have been updated, i have to go to each and every one of them. very annoying. i've got about 10 websites that change every day. but if it's not new, it's kind of a waste for me to visit all these sites.

solution:
RSS.

basically, you setup an RSS &quot;reader.&quot; there are a ton of options -- Firefox has one built in (so does Safari), you can use Google Reader, or you can download a separate application that runs on your computer in the background. in this &quot;reader&quot;, you input all your RSS feeds. then, instead of checking each website, you check your reader (1 visit as opposed to many). via RSS, it can tell what websites have changed and lets you know (usually plain text and images -- no ads, extra info, etc.)

you'll find that most websites these days have RSS feeds. in your browser, an RSS icon ( [img:8wsqq5oh]http&#58;//crossthebreeze&#46;files&#46;wordpress&#46;com/2005/12/feed-icon32x32&#46;jpg[/img:8wsqq5oh]) will usually show up on the right side of the address bar if the site has an RSS feed.

For instance, here are the RSS feeds I have setup on Google Reader:

&gt; AP News Headlines
&gt; Engadget
&gt; Bouldering Born (golfer's blog)
&gt; ClimbLA
&gt; Coding Horror (a tech blog)
&gt; 2 Friends' Flickr accounts (so i get updated when they add pictures)
&gt; Fail Blog
&gt; Betabase (Yosemite bouldering)

i also have an RSS feed that will update whenever there are no routes/comments or pictures added to my favorite climbing areas on Mountain Project.

so rather than visiting these websites individually to see if anything is new, i just look at Google Reader (or other RSS reader app) to see what's new.

Make sense?

i use google reader, because i have one computer at work and one at home.  this way, i can tell which updates have already been marked as &quot;read&quot;


if you use firefox, it has &quot;Live Bookmarks&quot; which lets you bookmark your favorites sites as an RSS feed -- then the [i:45g7rjax]bookmark [/i:45g7rjax]tells you when the site is updated.  (Safari does this, too)

Tuesday night we are going to have a setting party so if anyone with experience is interested you can come up and set some problems, just let me know first so I can expect you and let the managers know. Bringing your own wrenches would probably be a good idea if you want to set seeing as we're gonna have a lot of people there already as everyone is super psyched to set on the new beast.

Overall the feedback from pretty much every climber that has seen the new area (including a lot of super strong and experienced climbers) is extremely positive.

I have  had a couple of guide books, where there is so much clutter that it requires you to re-orient yourself off of a single point and then work from there to find anything.  

For instance, if the guidebook for bishop sucked...all climbs would be drawn in the guide from the peabodies....so to find any one rock you would have to start there.  In good guides you can start from any point in the boulderfield and be fine  The more points of reference there are, the easier it is to find any specific climb.

Woodson is a great example of this....everyone who draws it up, uses the road and its curves as reference so it is really to find where you are.  In addition the author (hubbard) even put items like tele poles in there too.....";;"0";"EA==";"32x48goz";"1";"0";;"92";"0";"0"

It is a pretty killer climb with solid rock, fall is a little hairy though through the committing parts higher up. The peanut is fun and powerful moves. Still a lot of grainy crap coming off of it. So pick your pleasure. Does the fun out weigh the crap rock?? I don't know, but once you try it, you don't want to let it go undone.";;"0";"CA==";"13wos729";"1";"0";;"5";"0";"0"

Anyone got some good quotes? Could even be your own. If you don't feel like spraying em in public, you can PM me. Heck, I can even add em and leave it anonymous if you want it that way.

a great example is a John Long quote from Stone Crusade: &quot;People told me I was cheating if I lunged problems... There's a start and finish to every boulder problem and what I do in between is my own business.&quot;

Throughout the guide, we'll be feature small pieces on local figures such as Bob Kamps, Reardon, Stonemasters, et al. These quotes will add to the book's overall character and local flavor.

Let me preface this with the fact I think this is one of the best lines I have seen and would make my climbing life if I could send it. I noticed when watching videos of the SDS to the Mandala that no one Toni or Sean actually start sitting down. I have always understood a SDS to begin with your ass on the ground. Is the SDS to Mandala really just a low start to the problem or is this the accepted practice for a SDS now? I know I am splitting hairs here, but if I went to a new crag and the problem said SDS I would try it with ass on dirt. I know from experience that pulling your ass off the ground on a sit down is sometimes the crux of the problem. 

By the way bravo to all who have sent this problem from either start standard or low.

managed to put up two v4's and a vB (to downclimb!).  I also set a v3 that tops out near Matt's v3 (mine starts under the roof then moves up and left).

(you guys need to start taping feet -- i couldn't force matt into any cool moves because he was using every other hold on the wall...lame.)

i agree with Brady -- some VERY cool possibilities with this new setup. and i absolutely love topping out on a lot of those problems...tis a very new indoor experience for me.

Nailed it.

You can't use ANY feet at our gym though. Just the small jibs that aren't taped. You can't be stepping on jugs and whatnot... I hope you guys didn't get that impression.

In all honesty its really not THAT different from gyms that tape feet. I try to keep only really shitty feet on the walls so that proper foot work has to be used. And pretty much all sections are low enough on feet so that only one foot sequence is possible per move.

The major difference to gyms that tape feet is at those gyms you can force people into doing foot sequences in certain ways.";;"0";"gA==";"283c8vsh";"1";"0";;"23";"0";"0"

I've always felt that using &quot;any feet&quot; (even if it is just jibs) is just plain lazy (for both the setter and the climber).  

When a problem is set, it should be a complete package with a defined challenge for the climbers to attempt to follow and complete.  Bouldering is supposed to be climbing distilled down to clear and defined movement where the climber can strive for the hardest moves possible at his/her level.  Throwing multiple foot options into the mix changes this considerably IMO.

I also saw room for a couple of bolted routes on the creek's edge near the first boulders (maybe 4-6 short 3-5 bolt routes could be done on the bulging wall) and a steep arete climb opposite the shorter wall that would be longer.

When researching for that book, it seemed like every potential area I went to research I ended up adding routes to.  I just wasn't up for doing that yet again.

Friday (at the happys) was really warm in the sun. Probably 80's but on the canyon walls in the shade with the breeze, it was more low 70's. 

Saturday was warm at the golf course. 15 people showed up for golf which = 3 teams of 5. John (Verm) Sherman, myself, Brian Rhodes, Adam Lincoln, and some dude named Jody were the first team (team crimp). We won with 2 over par I think. Brian was doing keg stands at all of the water fountains and we moved the flag to the sandtraps for the group behind us.  Brian also let Verm pose for a tee off from his mouth for a photo. Verm actually hit the ball and scared the crap outa Brian. 

A second team consisting of a bunch of people I don't know was asked to stop climbing the trees with their shirts off. Later I found out they were trying to get cell reception. 

The third team consisted of E.Z. and fiance , his brother Troy, Buck, and 2 others. They started with a shot of tequila at the first hole. Not sure how many drinks all together but on hole 5 a fight almost started. A ball landed next to some hot headed regulars cart. He proceeded to cuss them out AFTER they apologized. This pissed off Troy who threw down his clubs and gave the guy a push. It escalated a little bit before hot head backed down, left his wife behind and took his golf cart full boar to security (not caring who's games he drove thru and interupted.) Turn's out the guy was a known problem so we were all in the clear. Entertaining to watch though. 

Sunday (at the buttermilks) was again really warm. In the shade it was perfect, almost chilly even. No snow anywhere that I saw. A guy named Ian did Mandala right behind us after about 10 minutes working it. He then repeated it 5 min. later with ease. 

All in all a good weekend. Townsend Brown, Mellisa Higbie, and John Custer (all ex rockreation people) made appearances. Many were missed.";;"0";"CA==";"33evum8s";"1";"0";;"5";"0";"0"

It looks like it had been previously discovered, however I do not believe it was climbed based on the loose rock that was dislodged for the feet during my ascent. If someone sent this before let me know I am tenatively calling it Jigsaw (V7?) and I am unsure of the rating, but it is harder then Holy Roller whatever the consensus is on that problem. The problem starts on a half pad crimp for the right hand and a minimal gaston for the left.

The feet are under the belly of the boulder. Powerful lock to another half pad crimp.

Part of the crux is staying off the boulder left and hitting the boulder behind you. A little body tension can help this. This is some off the coolest rock at Steele Valley. The boulder sits behind Ultamatum about 100-200 yards to the north on a hill top near the backside road. Let me know what you think if you climb it. By the way the really nice looking hold chalked out left is really only accessible starting higher on the problem. The boulder cannot be missed look for the jigsaw face.

Good luck enjoy.

Look for two parallel, diagonal thin cracks that face the road on a solitary tower.  The thin crack has been bouldered by yours truly.  It's an amazing climb that's hardest getting onto the problem and started up the crack.  It's a little tall, but the higher you get - the easier it is.  I worked it ground up since it has a nice, flat landing.  Most of the rest of that circuit is found on the back of the rock and on the boulders immediately surrounding it, but there is room for much more in the vicinity.

That's the one I remember.  

The other area I was talking about is on the opposite side of the road and much lower.  Start looking for it as you get to the main intersection before you head up the hill.  It will be straight ahead as you approach the intersection and on your right as you begin up the main hill.

Also, from the Jigsaw Boulder, head more or less straight left along the ridge and there is room for some cool stuff too.  In fact on the far left end of that ridge (300 yards or so) is a long wall that has two good flake problems on it.  The right one is The Flame (picture of Chris Lindner on it in the gallery on this site).  We only did those flakes and a few problems on the taller rock right of it.

This hillside was what we were starting to explore when I stopped going there originally.  I imagine there's a lot yet to be found and done there.

Also the whole about the author section in the back of the book is pretty entertaining. For everyone who doesn't know RTM very well . . . .
a direct quote from the back of the tram guidebook - 

&quot; Robert Miramontes has been a So Cal &quot;local&quot; Boulderer for nearly 20 years, and is responsible for putting up hundreds of problems, including single-handedly finding and developing the Underground of Jtree. Rob started out climbing at Joshua Tree National Park and became instantly obsessed with bouldering and exploring the area. This obsession culminated with the writing of &quot;A Complete Guide to Joshua Tree National Park,&quot; his first book. Eager to branch out, he headed to the mountain retreat of Tram bouldering, and was blown away by the quality of the climbing. Spurred on by the vague and incorrect documented information, the plan was hatched to do a guide for Tram. Not having the same knowledge and experience as Jtree, the author went on a 5 year pilgrimage, to become an expert on the subject of Tram bouldering. During this time, he drew topo's (all 180 of them) and designed Troy Mayr's 3rd Edition Southern California Sport Climbing Guide.  Finally, with the completion of the Tram guide, Robert plans on developing a website on So Cal Bouldering, and someday hopes to learn to sculpt Iron. 

In an unrelated past life, Rob enjoyed a fixation on Skydiving, entering many competitions, including two world championships, and was ranked 5th and 6th, in '95 and '96, in the world in Freestyle (acrobatic) Skydiving.&quot;

Well the Rockreation crew is now all back in So Cal after a fun trip to Bishop.  It started last Wednesday when me and the girl and my little pup Olive got up bright and early to drive out in the morning.  We set up camp at the Buttermilks and were climbing at the Happys by noon.  I got on Rave and convinced Liz to try some stuff on the Totty boulder.  Miles, Katie, Do, Nathan, Meg, Matt, Angela, Anthony T., Anthony N, April...hope I'm not forgetting anybody...showed up later that afternoon.  And finally Luke and Brianne showed up with the beer after midnight.  They thought it'd be a good idea to buy three (YES THREE!!) kegs despite only staying two full nights.  You do the math...cause they didn't!  They drank their part though :wink.  

Day two was also spent at the Happys with highball sends of Rene, Black Magic, and some tourism on the local favs of the Happy Boulder.  Some girls that Do invited would show up and remain quite the rest of the trip, seriously can't even remember their names.

Day three we went to the milks FINALLY!  We got on Fly Boy, Iron Man, and Seven Spanish Angels where we ran into rtm.  Unfortunately that day would end with Katie spraining her ankle, but she would stick around to cheer us on.  Timetraveler and Thor showed up that afternoon as well.  We also met friendly guy Joe from Colorado and buddy Matso (sp?) from Austria.  They would join our &quot;team&quot; and prove helpful in getting through the kegs!  Terrence and Timmy showed up on their bikes that night.  And my buddy Tan who now lives in LA would show up to join us as well bringing our team total to 23...I think...I dunno I lost count!

Day four we went to the Sads and got on Pow Pow, Strength in Numbers, Beefcake and some other classics.  Doing Pow Pow, in the cave with surrounding boulders filled with cheering friends, honestly made the whole thing feel like I was in a comp!  Many sends, many falls, many laughs!

Day five, many people went home.  The remainders tried the Checkerboard, but few sent.  

Day six, only myself, the girl, the dog, and Joe and Matso remained.  The trip went downhill from here.  It started when I noticed a screw in my tire in the morning.  Small town inflation and limited selection means I now have some overpriced but kickass BFGoodrich All Terrain tires on my ride.  I took the rest of the day off, checked into the hotel and came down with a cold.  5 days of climbing and the day I relax my body shuts down! 

Day seven, the girl and I went back to the Buttermilks to try a few things.  I tried Iron Fly about 157 times before my fingers started getting blood blisters trying to stick the crimp.

Day eight, we went to the Happys and with no power left decided to get on some easy highballs and warmup-type problems.  I did 20 problems, most of them under V1.  It was fun and I was tired.  Liz got on some easy stuff and even my dog Olive sent a three star VB!  We drove home and made great time, making it home for my mom's home cooked Udon.  

Good times.  Here's some pics.  I didn't take many because Nathan has a much better camera and was taking pics the whole time, I'll try to get his web address:

The girl (Liz) happy at the Happys on the Totty Boulder.  Thought it'd be a good idea to forgo the spot and take pictures despite it being her first time climbing outside.  Yeah!  Way to score points!

hmmm....don't quite get what you mean.

in the graph that you see above, you are seeing (guessing at the numbers, don't have them in front of me):
- 2 V3's
- 9 V4's
- 4 V5's
- 20 V6's
- 6 V7's

the max number on the left side of the graph (22) is a function of the max number of sends (20 [V6's]), times 1.1, and rounded up to the nearest whole number.  the 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 numbers go from there.  then on the graph, the rest of the sends are plotted and are accurately displayed based on the range/graph size.

let's say, in this scenario, we had this:
- [b:1f82hje1]200[/b:1f82hje1] V3's
- 9 V4's
- 4 V5's
- 20 V6's
- 6 V7's

max value would be 220, mid would be 110...  therefore, those piddly little 4 V5's are going to be small on the graph.  is that what you're asking?  obviously, this scenario would be incredibly rare -- to have so many sends in a single grade and not have others around it.  

if you can see a better way to have the graph operate, i'm all ears.  if you wanna see some other scenarios, post some total numbers here and i'll show you what the graph looks like.";"07913b107865230256fd34db4d9431d9";"0";"wA==";"1f82hje1";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

the bold answers my question.  I was just saying that the increments are different.

Most SDS starts really start at specific holds and not with your ass on the ground because of varying body types.

Turns out they were later than I and saw me as I was about to leave.

Had a good day. Warmed up at the dance floor. Put up a really neat ultra highball just up from [i:1lb3hzr6]humping the walrus[/i:1lb3hzr6]. It is next to some v1ish highball crack that's not in the book. I don't think it has gone before but I don't know. Really cool though.  V2 ish maybe with a bad fall. There is room for more lines on it too!!

Went down and played on Dancing Queen with 10 kids from hanger 18. Did Byron's roof/mosquito cove/the depression plus the wills problems on the boulder next to it. 

Went to power windows for Pilo and Carry to work on. That is a killer problem. I had forgotten how fun it is. 

To finish things up, we went crashpad sledding across the stream from angus. Nice slick steep hill that ends badly into trees. The cordless pad was a little slow and stopped at the bottom, but my flashed pad was like a bobsled and we had to bail off before hitting the trees. This could be a regular run until the snow is completely gone. O

Without a doubt, one of the finer after bouldering burritos (list available on request, areas covered from San Diego to Santa Barbara and points East).  

Alas, the Coyote closes at 7, killing our dreams.  O'skool is willing to cobble together a suicide bomber vest or chain his naked screaming body to the place demanding longer hours so we can get our fix.  Neither of these things do I want to see.  So a stop in the blossoming metropolis of Banning/Beaumont is required.  Sure we find burritos in a decent little place, but $10 each and no beer just doesn't fit the bill. 

So here's the project part - If you're holding out on the burrito beta, spill it.  We need a new joint.  The great taste test has begun.  We spied some options and the next weeks are going to be interesting. 

What does this have to do with bouldering, fucking everything.  If you asshats don't like it, piss off. (i heart internet aggression)";"4486644c9931d413f4d1b49253f969e8";"0";;"q40d9o0d";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

Does the ranger service have any evidence beyond this confrontation? If not, that is some wheak circumstantial.

Its sad that we still think about it as battle against the man, since its a battle already won, maybe not for climbing but for the public using the land that is deemed &quot;theirs&quot;. Why do you need a permit (adventure pass e.g.) for something you have a right to, getting permits implies asking permission. It just seems that the rangers like the police aren't there to protect you or serve you, they are there to emit the authoritarian aura that keeps everyone inline and who needs to be kept inline in the middle of the desert. One example of the shift in attitudes that I have noticed is that awhile back(pre NPS) some friends and I were partying at Jumbo, things got out of control and a ranger showed up. Everyone was smashed and everyone was sub 21 and all we got was a &quot;come on guys wrap it up&quot;. Then about a year ago parked at planet x and ready to depart I whipped out a slingshot and fired it into the desert all of a sudden super ranger in his super expedition rolls up out of nowhere, literally out of thin air, seriously he maneuvered that beast like he was on 21 jump street. 20 minutes and a pretty serious talking to about &quot;weapons&quot; in a national park later and I was $50 poorer and had 1 less slingshot. When I called in to get my slingshot back and pay the $50 the lady on the phone said she had been working there for an eon and never had heard of such a thing happening, i never got my slingshot back. I'm sorry Bee but I have no reserves left for the NPS or its sentries. The NPS telling me what I can and can't do is hard for me to grasp since they have done far more destruction than I could ever pull off. Maybe I'm just frustrated because me and satya just got a $25 fine and a $25 processing fee for taking a nap after an all night bouldering session in the echo cove parking and without being slanderous I can say that he was a cheeky little bastard. Maybe I'm just frustrated because I eat, work and sleep in a places of rules and regulations upheld by sometimes very assertive authorities and I just want to go to the desert or mountain and experience something a little more real without having someone hold my hand and tell me to do this or don't do that. I guess I'm just frustrated.";"bfce30b1f4704fc4b176af37093bf1a5";"0";;"20s1fdcj";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

If it's a climber, it's up to you to decide what the best next move is. That's your decision and yours alone. I'm sure the rangers have their gloves on to implement the requisite spanking. 

If it's not a climber, then we should wait and see the outcome, after which we can determine the best form of action. 

Personally, I find that there has been a subtle but marked change in policy in all government organizations I've dealt with including those I've read about towards law enforcement, and the park service is definitely no stranger to that. The former nat'l monument rangers and the older park service rangers had a more laid back approach to policy enforcement, and the newer rangers clearly have been trained to expect something in that they are more nervous, more apt to assume guilt and very much committed to enforcement as a means to an end. I'm even inclined to state this might be a consequence of the post 9/11 fallout. 

I say this because I was in the DMV today, and someone had left a suitcase unattended. I watched as the security guard became more and more alarmed as to what he might have to do, that when a man came forward to claim it, the security guard went off on him why he didn't answer the guards announcements previously. The guard was angry, but also relieved that he didn't have to do anything more. 

The ticket that barracho is speaking about is going to be fought, and he is accurate as far as I'm concerned, in his assessment of the events. The ranger was very much committed to enforcement without taking literally any time to discuss it. I spoke nicely to him and tried to explain what happened, and he was tearse to the point that he wanted nothing to do with us except to give me the ticket. He even put on the ticket &quot;not signed,&quot; but he never asked me to sign the ticket, which implies to a judge that I'm not cooperative. He also forget to check the box that requires me to pay or go to court. In other words, I'm going to fight this based on two points: one, we weren't camping, and two, the officer (more apropos) didn't properly fill out the paperwork, so the judge should not give him slack as the officer didn't bother to understand and give us slack. 

Regardless, my point is that just because there is policy doesn't make it just or right. Accepting things and complying with them is tantamount to agreement and support. The adventure pass is, as far as I'm concerned, not only class biased, but fundamentally against the policy of public land use. How come it's acceptable to spend more on defense then the entire world combined, yet we have to charge for access to public lands? We, the USA, continually step closer and closer to a police state without being one. Is this excessive? Maybe, but I can't see the logic or justification in public land use policy whilst we kill people for corporate interests in other lands.

Dissension is our right; it's everyone's right. Period. 

Regarding the issue of Bee's comment &quot;...and it's not very productive to demonize rangers -- we'd lose a battle against the MAN.&quot; I disagree in that I don't think the ranger is demonized because borracho is only expressing his opinion based on first hand experience. His approach might not be to your or other's liking, but it's his opinion nonetheless.

What are the numbers on the left side of the tick list?  Well I mean I know they're the number of problems at that grade but shouldn't they go up incrementally?  i.e.  5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. [/quote:3l2qc3zz]

The numbers on the left dynamically change based on your max amount of sends in a given range.  (does that make any sense?)  So, in the example above, the graph shows 18 V6 sends -- therefore the top of the graph is 22, and the midline is 11, and every other tick falls into place.  So yes, the numbers on the left change depending on your particular list.[/quote:3l2qc3zz]

That makes sense, but are the other ticks rounded up or down or something.  Doesn't that give more emphasis on the middle of the graph, thus somewhat misleading?  I'm splitting microscopic hairs here, I know.

[quote=&quot;fraction&quot;:3l2qc3zz][quote=&quot;Stretch&quot;:3l2qc3zz]
Also, where does the suggested grade and suggested rating come from?  Who decides that? [/quote:3l2qc3zz]

the &quot;suggested grade&quot; and rating is what [u:3l2qc3zz]you[/u:3l2qc3zz] gave the route when you &quot;ticked&quot; it.  the consensus is an average of all of these from other users.  (if you decide to add a problem to your tick list, it will be required for you to also suggest a grade and star rating for the consensus)[/quote:3l2qc3zz]

If the government didn't adopt such policies So Cal would be even more exclusive than it already is. Similarly, if the gov't didn't designate J-Tree as a National Park it may have been bought by a developer, subdivided and sold off for [color=#408000:1u7u80s2]$$$$[/color:1u7u80s2] (maybe).

Based on my experience with climbing magazines and their editorial staff, I can say without a doubt that they take liberties as to which portion of their letters get printed (and in what context) and definitely skew the printed word to favor their &quot;heroes.&quot;

That's not to say that Joe's letter may not have happened, but I would not be surprised if what Brady's putting out there was actually what really happened.

first off, saturday:

Gettin' all gung-ho for the girls, Kristen from San Diego got a rare female ascent of &quot;El Diablo&quot; V4, a cranky problem with a scary rock at your back for the crux. way to not break your spine, Kris!

A-ron got to watch his new highball &quot;i'm gay&quot; repeated by Damon Corso and Alan Moore, while i climbed half way up and then cried like Susy the girl with a sandy vag. awesome!

following that inspiring performance, Aron got the flash and 2nd ascent of &quot;High Castle&quot; my previously unrepeated highball line right of &quot;i'm gay&quot;. 

continuing on, Alan  &quot;naked&quot; Moore and myself worked on an unrepeated Dan Mills V10 called &quot;Danimal&quot; that is to the right of Black Mamba; we figured out all the moves but were unable to link, but the problem is really good and deserves traffic; there was no chalk on it when we started working it, as Mills sent it about 2 years ago and its not been tried since.

Alan did all the moves on Devils Dance -V12ish- good job Alan!

yours truly repeated Stretch Armstrong V10 exactly 5 months to the day since i broke my femur, and i was able to achieve this without breaking it again. awesome!

Sunday was another beauty, with some BFD sends...for those not in the know, that means Big Fucking Deal and deservedly so! 

as a teaser, we had a brittish fellow visiting, Mike Rude(!) and boy is he true to name; between dirty smutty sex jokes, he inspired everyone to raise their cock-err...game! yeah game, and much sending occurred:

Mike came really close to a one day ascent of &quot;Left Hand of Darkness&quot; V10, falling off the V2 moves...wanker!!! &quot;neat try Toooby&quot;.

Mike did indeed flash Blue Flame V6 towards the end of the day to make up for all the fisting he did.

Damon Corso made a 2nd try ascent of &quot;9112K4&quot; V7/8 a problem i put on the anniversary of 911.

showing for the girls out there, Cindy Foster crushed &quot;Aquaman&quot; V5(?) in good form.

I established 2 great new problems that are really great, the great &quot;Hershey's Kiss&quot; V3 and the great &quot;Chocolate Frisbee&quot; V1; did i mention, both problems are great? they both utilize large, black zenoliths that are very lovely chocolatey holds.

 &quot;kiss&quot; is a little grainy and tall, and requires a sketchy crack down climb, but it should clean up with traffic; some arete moves lead to a perfect Hersheys Kiss shaped xenolith that has a brilliant thumb catch, followed by a long long move to some grain slopes. this problem is near the Dance Floor.

&quot;Choclate Frisbee&quot; looks like someone tossed a great big black frisbee disc into some white granite where it stuck, and then someone snapped the edge off...this 'frisbee' xeno leads to a nice undercling and fun but still chossy climbing above. this problem is near the Boardwalk.

edit: from what i just read, Aron sent &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; V9 in a few tries today; good job Aron!!

well, thats pretty much all that happened....yep...thats it......................um.........yeah, well that is it i think...........OH WAIT!!!!!!!!!!! News Flash! 
Damon Corso climbed the undone Michael Reardon Memorial Crack, AKA &quot;House of Pain&quot; V6 on his 2nd go of the season!!!! 
The story for this impeccable line is that Reardon was close to sending before he passed, and Miramontes went ahead and put the line in as Reardons FA in his guide; however it never was climbed, until today.

Armed with a full compliment of  pads (around 10 i think) and aided by a nice four foot snow drift making it not quite so tall, Damo sent in fine style, cranking out the mildly overhanging thin cracks and crimps for 25 feet of Tuolumne like brilliant granite sending!! Damo dedicated the ascent to his lost friend Michael Reardon. Needless to say it was a fine moment and a nice bit of climbing by Damography. i will post pics soon.";"400282a5513c8244b7368e96a2eae923";"0";;"1ig2ms31";"1";"1208504634";;"14";"1";"0"

a.ron also did a nice 30ft highball up near Black Eyed Pea -- V2 start, then 5.8 above that.  nice big line on top of a pinnacle.

anybody know what climb Linder's doing in the first main sequence?  left to right seam with the awkward mantel?

Went over to paper dragon first and got spit off of just about all of the warm ups. We were pretty much laughing the whole time and couldn't be serious so we just kept falling off of everything. 

As a next option we decided to go look for soul caliber. Found Tree attack on the way. I did it pretty quick. Pilo got almost to  the jug but was a little timid without a second spotter present. Evidently she was attacked by the tree at the base last time she was there. We wondered up the hill just looking until we found soul caliber. That problem looks pretty cool. Next time we'll get on it. 

Hit the bar at the top. Ginger, the bartender, is pretty cool. Christina made friends with her and she was giving us all sorts of random little drinks she had learned to make.  <!-- s:hammer; --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/all_coholic[1].gif\" alt=\":hammer;\" title=\"party animal\" /><!-- s:hammer; --> 

We got the 9:00pm tram down and decided to go to the jups so she could send Suck My Venus. Insanely windy there. We pulled out the headlamps and trudged our way in. I thought I sent it, until I got home and looked in the book. So I guess I did the v5 exit. Pilo did do it however at about 10:30pm as the pads blew away. She was super stoked. It was cool.

&quot;Harry Pothead&quot; used to be a V9, and a hard one at that.

&quot;Methamphetamine&quot; starts down and right of where its shown, on some slopey rails; starting further right wouldn't add a V grade. Both prolly solid V9

What is called &quot;Butt Draggin Arete&quot; V3 in the book was called &quot;Draggin Yer Ass&quot; by Garrett Gregor, who bagged it, not me.

&quot;Return of the Dragon&quot; next to it might be very hard for V3.

On the Barefoot Sharma Boulder, the left line used to be V10; apparently its V8 now? Perhaps not V10, but V7...?. the right line as well, surely the hardest V7 at Tram, next to:

&quot;Tribe Called Conquest Direct&quot; V7(?) as far as i know, only 2 people have climbed it, Dan Mills and G-Unit, both strong climbers; they both struggled, and called it V10 &amp; V11 respectively. I have tried it as well, might be a bit harder than V7...

The first line i climbed on the &quot;Solitude&quot; arete was a low start into the first juggy hold, where i headed up onto the slab; fun climb, but the low start is now very hard, so you could just start at the jugs and climb onto the slab; maybe V5ish.

Numbers 617 and 618 in the book, on the Green Tea boulder, share a start, then head left and right, &quot;Flying Fairy&quot; and &quot; Airy Fairy&quot; awesome problems. Perhaps V3/4?.

This ones confusing:
Number 713 in the book is actually &quot;Staghorn&quot;. What is called &quot;Staghorn&quot; is actually &quot;White Stag&quot; V6/7ish. &quot;Buckhorn&quot; is 716 into 715.

Lots of rock there, including some great toprope climb (20-30') and room for a lot of additional new stuff.  When Dean, Craig, Scott and the rest first starting going there I have no doubt that a lot of bushwacking was involved.

He called it Meth Lab v9. Years later, people were doing a line there, calling it Methamphetamine. I realized it was just a shorter version of what Kevin did, but I thought the line had merit, so I listed it. 

People have been climbing Solitude starting from good slopers about 7ft. high and following the arete all the way around. The consensus is that this classic line goes at v8. 

Paul Rocks on Pauls Rock is rated v4 in the book, in the dead of summer maybe, but on a crisp winter morning, its probably more like a 2. 

Soul Caliber was supposed to be rated v9, not sure why this was not changed. 

Clawing at the Belly of the Beast is forming a concensus at around v10/11, up from Ryans proposed v8. Taller peeps think easier, shorter think harder.

i did &quot;Harry Pothead&quot; last weekend. i dont know of anybody else doing it.

if Kevin &quot;Plastic Mullet&quot; Hovey says he did &quot;Meth Lab&quot; from the far right, we believe him? hmmm.....

but yeah, as for Methaphetamine, me and Ryan Held were both falling vying for the FA; he never went back, so i assumed i got it. if Kevin really did Meth Lab, that would basically abolish my FA. otherwise it would be like me doing &quot;Boardwalk&quot; from halfway, re-naming it, and calling it an FA. Basically, &quot;Methaphetamine&quot; doesnt exist (although it is a much better problem than the right start).

Saturday was a hike up to the Crow's Nest to show Damo &quot;Bad Mutha Fucka&quot; so he could get the 2nd ascent of this beautiful line; however a very sizable snow drift relegated the start impossible....

some nice FA's happened though, notably Damo's &quot;Da Hook&quot; a sweet hi-ball on a nice hook like fracture...scary looking!

yeah the &quot;Bionic Butt Pirate&quot; also went down, a line i had been saving that starts with a huge move then leads to nice arete climbing on Buttermilk like rock. pics of those soon...

Sunday was beautiful out, with T-O-Dubble climbing one of the sweetest chunks of rock i have ever seen, some caramel thunder stone!!!

Start as per &quot;Blue Flame&quot; but go into &quot;Stretch Armstrong&quot;; would be contrived, but hard...if you did the same start but finished &quot;Danimal&quot; you would be GOD.

SDS to &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;

the Gold Wall slashes; again contrived but so cool

The &quot;Black Mt. Project&quot;; me and Mills used to try this one, till a foot broke; still goes,  just hard...

Full traverse into &quot;Black &quot;Widow Bite&quot; from the right.

Low start to &quot;Green Tea Arete&quot;

the arete sqeezer below &quot;Solitude&quot;

&quot;Solitude&quot; from the SDS now that the hold broke...seems less fun but surely hard.

low start to &quot;Attack of the Staph&quot; would add 2 moves...Mills tried it for a bit.

the arete right of Green Tea has holds...

the &quot;Slimer&quot; project, which is in Picasso's Prism Palace: slopers on flowstone below &quot;Dan's Satanic Arete&quot;

1. Site contributors, people like Dameat could continually send RTM updates on what is going on in his bouldering world. As a south OC resident I have no idea what is going on at most crags. I think the tram, josh updates are good and if we could get others to add their knowledge of whats going on then the site continue to grow. 

2. The second option is RTM and crew start scrubbing the web daily for news, this takes work and I do not know if these guys have the time based on the repeating photos (Sorry, I just could not resist). And/or set up reciprical information agreements with other sites to share information and images.

So either the group steps up with information for RTM (some of you already are doing this) or RTM quits his day job to post news flashes/photos from around Socal. I am guessing we need to help, RTM is married now.

20 feet behind Humpin a Walrus or whatever its called at the Dance Floor theres a boulder with 2 shorty problems that are both quite hard. One (under a little roof with a boulder a few feet behind you) is a huge chuck from a shize xenolith to a sloping jug, the other (to the right) is a super balancy technical little son of a bitch to a blasphemous sloping topout.

i'm working on the part of the database where we assign ratings to problems.  here are my 2 questions:

1.  do we call the difficulty of a boulder problem &quot;rating&quot; or &quot;grade&quot;?  &quot;rating&quot; can be confused with &quot;stars&quot; ... but &quot;grade&quot; sounds like M1, etc.

2.  how granular do you want the rating/grades?  currently, i'm looking at:

...
V1-
V1
V1+
V1-V2
V2-
...

Is this too much?  Should I restrict it to:

...
V1
V1-2
V2
...

??



i'll check this post in a few hours.   i've got a flight back to LA at 7pm and I'll finish this code tonight, so post up soon.

Go with either pluses and minuses OR slashes.

V1-

Agreed.  So the next question becomes:  Do we go with +/-, or V1/V2??

V0-


Look good??  Or should we scrap 5.8/5.9 and just say that V-Easy is anything below V0- (my vote).

So the completed scale would look like this:

V-Easy
V0-
V0
V0+
V1-

earlier in the day, Jay also got his first Tram FA; a beautiful arete up to a highballish top! He dubbed it &quot;Talking Shit About

this is going faster than i anticipated, but it's still a shit-load of work.  hopefully, i'll have something for you guys to play with and give feedback on in 3-4 weeks...assuming i stay non-busy at work.

here's a shot of what a &quot;problems&quot; page looks like (notice the video integration! woot!):

You will always find someone who thinks a probelm is hard for the grade and someone who thinks the same problem is easy for the grade. Use the +/- the see what the consensus is as more and more people contribute and the real grade will eventually flush out.

Fraction the database looks very good, nice work.

By Melissa Pinion-Whitt
Article Created: [b:1h1otv2u]05/01/2008[/b:1h1otv2u] 08:28:26 AM PDT

A 700-acre brush fire burning in the San Jacinto Wilderness is not expected to be fully contained until Wednesday, fire officials said today.
The Apache Fire, burning at Apache Peak and the San Jacinto Wilderness in southwestern Riverside County, was reported at 4:35 a.m. Tuesday.

The wind-driven blaze forced the closure of the wilderness, Mt. San Jacinto State Park, and a number of hiking trails.

More than 600 firefighters battled the blaze and had it about 5 percent contained this morning, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Jim Behm.

&quot;It's taking crews three-plus hours to walk to the fire from the nearest trailhead, so it's quite a hike for them just to get to the fire,&quot; Behm said.

Firefighters used two helicopters and four fixed-wing planes to battle the blaze. No structures were threatened.

The numbers on the left dynamically change based on your max amount of sends in a given range.  (does that make any sense?)  So, in the example above, the graph shows 18 V6 sends -- therefore the top of the graph is 22, and the midline is 11, and every other tick falls into place.  So yes, the numbers on the left change depending on your particular list.

the &quot;suggested grade&quot; and rating is what [u:1fcw24wr]you[/u:1fcw24wr] gave the route when you &quot;ticked&quot; it.  the consensus is an average of all of these from other users.

i usually test every feature with outlying numbers and worst case scenarios.  even so, there are bound to be kinks in the system.  hopefully i'll have a Beta for everyone to play with sometime in June and we can squash some bugs.

After much thought (oh how my MA Thesis has suffered!) I think this whole business of giving a straightforward definition in misguided. Beta isn't simply a matter of information. Imagine a boulder problem with a crucial heel hook. You would never have thought to get a heel hook on that particular hold, it is around the corner and somewhat hidden, but there is a large tick mark that wraps around the arete. Based on this tick mark you make the straightforward conclusion that you should heel hook the hold. It seems to me, and I think this isn't wrong, that you haven't gotten beta on the climb simply by seeing the tick and concluding the heel hook.

Now contrast this with a situation in which there is no tick, but the person with you has been on the climb and tells you about the secret heel hook. You have clearly received beta here, but oh no! the information you've gotten is exactly the same as in the last scenario. Because of this, I find it unlikely that beta is simply a matter of information.

Alright, so our attempt at providing a definition for beta has been a failure so far. What else could it be? Perhaps &quot;beta&quot; is a functional notion, defined in terms of an onsight and a flash. Again then: &quot;beta is whatever it is that precludes an onsight.&quot; Typically this will be information, but notice that on this definition, it is not solely a matter of informational content. The role that this information plays is what is fundamental, that is, information that would turn an onsight into a flash.

I've got to say, this isn't the most informative explanation. After all, we still don't know all that much about onsighting and flashing - we are still ten years away from a decent analysis of these concepts. And we can still ask, what is this mysterious thing that makes an onsight into a flash? What are its characteristics, its properties, both intrinsic and contingent. Yet after thinking about various definitions, I'm not sure we can avoid a functional analysis like this.

Look at those analytic tools you learn from philosophy! How useful, how powerful! What do others think?

Lets now move onto the subject of a tick mark. I believe that it is just a mark identifying a feature on the rock, yet it does not provide a clear perspective on how exactly the feature should be utilized. I would like to emphasize the word &quot;clear&quot; from the previous sentence because the perspective has to be clearly portrayed to the individual for beta to exist. Without this clarity all a tick mark does is mark features on the rock. It does not identify which feature is to be used in which order and in what manner.

I'm sure my thoughts will spark Dr. Moore's curiosity and I believe he will in turn provide me with his beta on the subject.

You haven't convinced me that beta is not information based.  Your example of a tick mark when you're alone is just like the bolded example given above.  And the bolded example [i:28lhgr0g]is[/i:28lhgr0g] information based, just not information given verbally or physically by somebody else.  Regardless of whether it was &quot;cheating&quot; to think about how the tick might be used, you gained information that you didn't have before, you now have the beta! 

Actually, I think you started pretty close to a good definition and went further from it as you continued with your dissertation.  You then went on to say that it has something to do with onsighting or flashing but you so quickly forget that the first thing you said was that beta is advice on how to climb but that you can receive bad beta.  So if I receive bad beta, it's still beta, and it's not helping me send, let alone onsight or flash.  Also, you say it could be anything that precludes an onsight or flash.  What else could it be but information?  So eating a  granola bar or a ham sandwich could be beta?  I'm glad you came to the same conclusion that onsighting or flashing is not relative here.

Very simply I think beta [b:28lhgr0g]is[/b:28lhgr0g] information given, received, or conjured through a variety of means that may or may not assist one in climbing a problem/route.  As someone else mentioned, beta is subjective, and this definition reflects that.

Onsight: you are a crag/bouldering area for the first time walk up to a problem/route and send it with no information on the climb. To include start here, cross there clip from here, this is the crux, back step there etc.

Flash: Send the climb/boulder on the first try with information on the climb/boulder.

Beta: Any verbal or written information that would help you on the climb/boulder.
I believe historically and some others climbing longer then me can correct me if I am wrong, but chalk on the route is not beta. Now I might have to say the tick is beta, but the chalk on the holds may just be random. Many time the chalk on a problem just leads you off the beaten path. Unfortunately, if a ticker is not responsible enough to clean their mess when finished, the aspiring onsight party may just have to deal with the flash.

The tick mark alone is not necessarily beta but it can result in finding or figuring out beta.  The way people throw the word around, it has to be information based and has nothing to do with how you received it.  My belief is that you can walk into the woods by yourself, clean a new problem, be the first to work the problem and figure out the beta.  It's still beta, nobody told you it, no chalk marks, may not work for anybody else but it's beta.";"501be011b8034b90df7ba63ebf6ceb39";"0";"gA==";"2zm15nwn";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

Chesty Magee said:

[quote:3eo5dycu]I believe that beta would be best defined as an outside entity providing clear perspective on a particular way to solve a problem. Whether or not that particular perspective will actually result in the solution to the problem does not matter, for beta is completely subjective.[/quote:3eo5dycu]
Similarly, FOREmer Golfer said:

[quote:3eo5dycu]Beta: Any verbal or written information that would help you on the climb/boulder.[/quote:3eo5dycu]
Here we find the idea that beta always stems from a source external to the climber. This is where I started my inquiry, but I just don't think this gets at the fundamentals of beta. The fact that one can get beta by one's self in the woods, climbing a boulder, makes me think that the fact that we verbalize beta is a merely contingent property. That being said, the etymology supports this externalist view. &quot;Beta&quot; was derived from Beta Max tapes. Originally, getting beta meant you literally watched a tape of someone climbing the route. Since then the term has evolved, so I don't want to read too much into this historical story, but the point is still a good one. 

Moving on, Stretch doubts that I have shown that beta is not information based:

[quote:3eo5dycu]You then went on to say that it has something to do with onsighting or flashing but you so quickly forget that the first thing you said was that beta is advice on how to climb but that you can receive bad beta. So if I receive bad beta, it's still beta, and it's not helping me send, let alone onsight or flash. Also, you say it could be anything that precludes an onsight or flash. What else could it be but information? So eating a granola bar or a ham sandwich could be beta?[/quote:3eo5dycu]
I probably wasn't very clear in the original post, but I meant to say that beta isn't solely information based - it is also about the role this information plays. I specifically didn't want to say that information that doesn't help (i.e. bad beta) isn't beta because it isn't useful the first time on a climb. What I want to do is spell out conditions for when information is beta (someone telling you a hidden foot, knowing the moves from having been on the climb before) and when it isn't (seeing the same foot because of a large tick, knowing the moves because they are obvious with chalk). I think that the difference here is grounded in the notion of flash and onsight. If the information precludes an onsight, it is beta. If not, it isn't it. So the arbitrator of beta is: if someone knows this information, could he/she (let's be gender friendly here) still onsight the climb? 

I'm sure everyone isn't happy with this, but does anyone agree? Am I full of shit? Ha! I do philosophy, of course I am.

And no to Ism, I do to much phenomenology already.

alan[/quote:6cw961ew]

I don't agree with this.  I don't see how seeing a large tick or chalked holds is that different from someone telling you about the same holds.  I do see now what you're getting at with the flash or onsight theory and while it's not my favorite, I see your point.

Can you example the bold statement?  Too many negatives for me to follow along.  <!-- s:? --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" /><!-- s:? -->   Regardless of what you're trying to say here, I think bad beta or beta that does not work could somewhat negate your flash/onsight notion, no?  

Anyhow, I stay put with my definition which you didn't really comment on.  Here it is again:

Very simply I think beta is information given, received, or conjured through a variety of means that may or may not assist one in climbing a problem/route. As someone else mentioned, beta is subjective, and this definition reflects that. But beta is also not always from an outside entity (i.e. alone in the woods example) and therefore can also be conjured individually through inductive/deductive reasoning, trial and error, mistake, etc.


Edited to add:
When thinking about it a little more the only real problem I have with your onsight/flash theory is that it defines an almost impossible-to-find-a-consensus word with other equally difficult to define words.  I much rather define it in terms of concepts we can agree on and save the other concepts for another debate.";"eaef4fd6f28b3af08140fb7e24f0471e";"0";"wA==";"6cw961ew";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

Its really fucking frustrating because it makes climbing very painful and campusing and system wall training nearly impossible.

I have tried keeping my fingernails nice and short and also a little longer and it doesn't seem to really seem to matter either way. I also have been moisturizing with some Burt's Bees hand lotion but it hasn't really seemed to do anything.

I think the main problem is where my fingernails attach to the tops of my fingers at the ends is extremely close to the tips, where on other people I see the connection is a little further back.

[quote:1axjsm2j]If i may.......
Think of chess.
Only this chess game is unique to each player in that each player owns different chess pieces that move according to a different set of rules. No two sets are alike. Now for each different person and their chess set there exists a perfect strategy or plan of action based on the opponents moves. As a good chess player one could reason and come to these perfect moves on his/her own, but they don’t have to. They may also be coached in any manner as to the best course of action for a particular situation.
The important idea here is that for each person and his/her chess set there is a best move based on statistics. If one plays a perfect game of chess than one will win over an opponent.
The idea of the statistically most logical move to make based on the situation and your particular chess set is it.
So, as an analogy to climbing this means that this idea is beta.
It is different for each person.
It is statistically the best move an individual can make based on their physical and mental attributes and for the given situation.
A climber can come to know the beta for a move by his/her reason alone.
Also, a climber can come to know the beta for a move by being coached in any manner.
The coaching method needs some explaining.
So, how can one be coached by another as to the statistically best method for performing a move when they are of course a different person? (Different Chess Set!) We will assume that know one knows what is statistically best for anyone but themselves. (Most people don’t even know what is best for themselves.) The answer is, they can’t, but there is a catch.
Just because I say heel hook on the hidden hold around the corner and it is the best way for me, doesn’t mean that it isn’t the best way for you to.
See what I am getting at.
So, if you are coached in any way as to the best way to do a move and it just so happens that it is the best way for you to do the move, than you have received beta. (No onsight)
I guess this also means that if you have been coached in any way as to the best way to do a move and it isn’t the best way for you, then you have not received beta.

That’s all I got for now, I am tired, I have to wake up at 5a.m., and I am not going to spent more time thinking about this.
I agree with you, this is pointless.
Never the less, I liked responding to your conundrum.[/quote:1axjsm2j]";"16429ba86a65dee2ff4ed9a92f3f7937";"0";"gA==";"1axjsm2j";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

I was trying to say that information that is of no use may still be considered beta. If someone tells me to use a drop knee, but I am all ham handed and can't get it, I still got beta. That was all I was going for in that confusing little sentence.

Now you also gave a positive view:

[quote:1p0tk0rv]Very simply I think beta is information given, received, or conjured through a variety of means that may or may not assist one in climbing a problem/route.

I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;beta is subjective.&quot; It isn't subjective in one way: if someone tells me how to do a climb, and I don't do it that way, I still got beta. It isn't like beta for one person is not beta for another. Sure, good beta for one person may be bad for another, but it is still beta. The crux here is describing what time of information constitutes beta. You don't address this issue, merely saying that beta is information &quot;given, received, or conjured through a variety of means.&quot; I am skeptical that you will have success spelling out the variety of means, and because of this I abandoned the idea of spelling out beta in terms of information alone. 

You final criticism is spot on though:

[quote:1p0tk0rv]
When thinking about it a little more the only real problem I have with your onsight/flash theory is that it defines an almost impossible-to-find-a-consensus word with other equally difficult to define words. I much rather define it in terms of concepts we can agree on and save the other concepts for another debate.[/quote:1p0tk0rv]
How is this for an answer: I've already defined beta, end of story? Not the most informative explanation though, is it? Oh the tribulations that come from reductive explanations - you have to explain what it is you are reducing the complex concept into. Another thread perhaps, what is an onsight and what is a flash?! I hope we can spell these out without invoking beta! Or damn, I'd be in trouble.";"82162f897f4731e24bdb2a4015cebc41";"0";"gA==";"1p0tk0rv";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

I don't think tick marks constitute beta anymore than chalk itself constitutes beta. Sometimes you walk up to a climb with tick marks and they help you get the onsight. Sometimes rain has washed off all the chalk, and this makes the onsight more difficult. Tough luck, if only all climbing were in a controlled environment, like a gym! Tick marks might be deplorable for other reasons (ugly, feo, haesslich), but not because they give beta.

My feeling is that if you are alone in the woods and figure out a climb, then that is one way you can conjured the beta.  You now have the beta.

You seem to be suggesting that even though you know how to do the problem, it really does not become beta until you tell someone else in the form of advice, correct?  hmmm...interesting...

I could go along with that, but there are occasions where you will say to someone who is struggling on a problem, &quot;hey, you want some beta on that problem?&quot;  and they say, &quot;no thanks.&quot;  That would indicate that you have the beta and did [u:2lxz1om5]not[/u:2lxz1om5] share it.

1) We find an impartial observer to measure the penis's of all male gym members. The average length of the top 10 members wins and the other gym is forced to close.

2) Dale and Zach have a three round mixed martial arts cage fight with the winner taking all. Zach has connections in this area so I think Dale might need to watch out.

3) We all go to church and hold hands. Maybe even buy undergarments together... then everything will be alright.[/quote:dpqxy4e3]


Hahaha. That's some funny shit.

In all honesty though I don't really find this to be a big deal. I don't like it... but business is business. I know from a lot of experience in the gym climbing scene that climbing gym owners are business people first and climbers second. When a lot of money is involved people tend to care less about the morals and ethics that their hobby community has.

Hopefully both gyms can be successful... but if one has to go down it will just be another small casualty in the world of businesses.";"a5629fae35ed2cf82e6e9e55b6b47382";"0";"gA==";"dpqxy4e3";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

There are plenty of 'normal' V9s at Tram, including the problems just listed. Karamel Sutra, Heel-a-Peel, the Matt Hoch prob, For the Love of Basic Cable, Vanishing Point, and Black Widow Bite all are V9 to me. Alan, are you really wondering what the deal is? V10 is harder than V9. there you go.

 most people believe SC to be V9 except for a couple exceptions. Angus and HP were always V9, i dunno where the V10 grades on those came from. Stretch and Year of the Cat used to be V9 as well. Stretch feels quite easy to me, but then i  have done it a half dozen times now, and its one move. but to say that either SA or Danimal is 2 grades harder than HP, SC, or Angus? nah...they feel just about right, like V9's. but hey, as more people do them, we can come to a group consesus, yay!!

so, mark Alan Moore down; &quot;feels that HP, SC, and Angus are soft V9 or even just V8&quot; and if others concur (i do not feel either problem would be V8, perhaps soft V9?) we can start to see. 

ps: you, Alan, are a strong guy. u know that, your head doesnt need any more inflating. u just climbed a V12, one that Daniel Woods couldnt do. maybe, just maybe, u cant tell the difference between V8 and V9 right now? hmm";"e4fe5e3cab4fcf451d2f34c8bda8f5bb";"0";;"3cit1z9p";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

Went to the Vanishing Point boulder first. 2Stars cruised it three times but kept PEing at the top. Now he has to quit his job so he can go mid week to finish it up so he doesn't have to cut himself in the shower anymore. I managed to finish up the Vanishing Point into Snowblind project I had been working on from the stand. Should bag it from the sit come Wednesday.

Afterwards we went over to Attack of the Staph which is fucking amazing. I wish I had some cardio because by the time I got up there I felt like a fucking wreck. Got pretty close on that rig and should be able to bag it as soon as I can convince someone else to hike up there with me again.

Lastly we went to Harry Pothead. Felt too wasted to even try to pull off the crimps at the bottom so we both just sent the mantle which is pretty cool. By the way the start looks harder than V8 but I guess this is the wrong thread to bring that up again in.

One last thing.... I think I left my sunglasses at Vanishing Point. If anyone saw them and happened to grab them or sees them before I get back up there you can keep them or give them back to me or whatever.

A massive boulder offering more square footage than the other Hangar location will probably be the main attraction for those on this site.  It's got the biggest &quot;cave&quot; terrain of any SoCal gym's bouldering, two large top-out sectors (one at 17 feet tall and one at 20 feet tall), along with plenty of terrain at other angles as well.

The lead climbing walls were designed to offer valid bouldering terrain up to about the 14-foot level, so this throws another 2000 or so square feet of bouldering options on top of the already HUGE main boulder.

There's plans to add more boulders down the road (and plenty of room to do so), so at some point the amount of bouldering terrain available will equal or surpass the roped climbing in the gym.

This new gym will host the 2009 ABS Regionals next Spring.

There is a lofty amount of science behind the sport of rock climbing that I think most of us rarely tap into. I don't know if its the because of the &quot;scientificness&quot; and the energy put into understanding it may be too much for some to handle. Or if most of the tips out there are just not as applicable as they should be. Regardless of the reason the information is out there. I have been doing a little research on my own for the last few months on the topic of Neuromuscular efficiency. I studied this for about a year in school at the National Academy of Sports Medicine while working on my degree and thought it would be a cool post for a forum.

So here we go hang on tight.

Neuromuscular efficiency is the ability of the neuro-musculo-skeletalsystem to allow agonists (big muscles), antagonists (oposing muscles exe: bicep &amp; tricep), synergists (smaller muscles that help the big muscles), and stabilizers (tiny muscles usually surrounding the joints) to work synergistically (together) to produce force, reduce force, and dynamically stabilize the entire kinetic chain. 

Wow! Holy crap what the Hell did that mean?

In more layman's terms... its means coordination. Its how well your muscles, nervous system, and you brain can
communicate. When it comes to sports whether climbing, baseball, or lawn bowling there is a certain matter of time  your neuromuscular system uses to adapt to a certain movement, motion, etc. In climbing we see this all of the time. Example: You're projecting a V7 at the Tram and your first few goes are horrible but after working the moves a few more times you slowly but surely are sticking sections of your project. What is happening here is your neuromuscular system went from speaking English and Spanish to speaking Spanglish. It takes time to warm up if its not trained often. 

Now the questions is... What about those climbers who flash hard problems all the time? Well they have awesome neuromuscular efficiency, and they're strong. For the rest of us who aren't flashing problems left and right here are some tips to make the time from your first go to your &quot;send&quot; much faster.

Work your hand eye coordination, foot eye coordination, core tension, balance, body stabilization, static movements, dynamics movements

This type of training takes a little more thought than traditional training regimens as well as the help of some cool out of the ordinary equipment. With my clients I often use a stability ball, airex foam pad, dyna disc, medicine balls, kettle bells, bosu balls, 1/2 foam roll, speed ladders, and floor markers. We have all of this equipment at our gym here in Riverside (Thresh Hold) if you want to ever stop by and try it out just let me know.

There are tons of sites on the topic as well as some articles by some of the smartest people in the world on sports medicine. 

Here are some videos that show some cool exercises:

Scattered showers and snow on Friday were present but limited.  Both days we've gotten plenty of climbing in.  I wish my tips could keep up with the giving weather though.  So much for it being too hot.  

The Mule Days crowd isn't that bad if you avoid the town during event/parade hours.  Plenty of camping.  We're camped at the milks, Carlos and Kat are at Horton.  Most of those mule loving red necks like to congregate at the fairgrounds.

We DID have a problem with finding camping but we probably should have claimed our site prior to climbing -- too anxious to climb! Sunday it rained on us a bit in the morning, then again in the afternoon around 2/3pm. I am shocked that it was dry until the end of the day at the gorge..but then again, I've never been to the gorge...knowing bishop, it could be an entirely unique sub-climate.  We did enjoy the glory of a dry and gorgeous Monday at the Milks, although we had to leave at 4:30 because I am a pansy (and that's all you need to know!). I diverge -- my point is that bishop weather is volatile. You need to be strategic or lucky - It's easy to choose an area that you anticipate will have good weather only to get rained on and then find that the area you were really pyshed on had perfect weather.";"56612e39ec4099b253b413f7d92a09e3";"0";;"19a1j44a";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

I would like to clarify a few of Dameats comments.  I did indeed establish a low traverse to the Pile ups boulder in 1989.  I named the problem &quot;Low and Behold&quot; and rated it B1+ which roughly translates to V6.  However, like virtually every problem at Stoney it has evolved due to hold breakage and is certainly different today than it was when I did it.  In addition Stoney Point is notorious for newcomers showing up and claiming first ascents of problems that were down years previous.  The truth is anyone who has climbed/bouldered at Stoney for any length of time is likely guilty of claiming a first of problem that was done many years previously myself included.  In fact I would not be surprised if the low traverse on pile ups had also been done prior to my claimed first ascent.  Climbers/boulders need to keep in mind that the likes of Kamps, Bachar, Yabo, Waugh, Yaniro, Johnson, Lynn Hill and the list goes on have crimped, cranked and dyno all over Stoney back in the day.  Just a little food for thought.  Keep on crankin!

Hmmm, weird - I remember the FA like this... Rob's ass was blowing up - Righter and I were falling on the last couple moves and getting irritated.

The two-day clinic (one day for bouldering and one for routes) will supply a Level One certification to those that complete it and it only costs $100 for the two-day clinic.  At present this certification is not required to set for local level comps, but this will not be the case in coming seasons.

If you have any interest in setting this is a great opportunity to pick up the certification and training at a low cost and to get input from one of the most recognized of US setters on your own setting style and skills.

It also gets you a sneak peak at the new gym before it opens to the public.

Space is limited and the slots are going fast so please contact me or Chris (<!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:CDanielson@gthi.com\">CDanielson@gthi.com</a><!-- e -->) if you want to take part.

 I think it would be good to sit down with the head ranger find out if there are any concerns with the climbing and the climbers at the tram. At that point those of us whom climb at the tram should get together as a group and make sure we are respecting the concerns of the forestry department. We do create an impact with large pads, unauthorized trail development, sometimes music, chalk (excessive tick marks), trash, etc.  Ignoring the concerns of the rangers will only lead to a boiling point leaving little chance of reconciliation.

We need to understand we are not the sole group using the tram and others may find our presence there a nuisance. I have been climbing at the tram for over 10 years and would hate to have this gem lost due to the act of the selfish. Where else can you go out and send quality problems during the summer and then end the day by killing a few pops with your friends at the bar. The tram bouldering is awesome, let’s keep it that way.

they are pretty fabulous, those two.

heres the skinny - we spoke with the rangers an told them that there are a bunch of climbers that are concerned with the increased impact, and want to do something to be proactive. They are going to discuss this topic at their next meeting and decide what we could do to help. At which point we will organise a day that we (us boulderers) can all get together and clean up or do whatever they decide that we can do. This will also serve as a template for organising cleanups at other bouldering areas.

In the meanwhile...trail building or altering the landscape is highly discouraged!! In fact, its illegal and will only make the situation worse! Obeying the rules, and filling out a backcountry pass when there, is by far the best thing we could do at this point. I'll post up the rules, incase anybody doesn't know them. Cleaning up tick marks and picking up trash will help. Respecting vegitation around boulders is another. 

Boulderers are not the biggest inpactors at Tram, and they are not singleing us out.  Its just easy for them to monitor our activities because all of the bouldering occurs in concentrated areas that are so close to the ranger station.";"d9bcf2457a5a42db9999a0088a824afc";"0";;"cgyh1uzo";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

I hope I didn't offend you with my comment. That wasn't my intent. I remember &quot;that day at Gluttony&quot; clearly...Ian, Kris, and Jeanie were patiently waiting for me while I failed on gluttony when a massive group ascended up the hill...I remember that day because the vastness of that group was unusual for the tram. Kris stopped climbing the prob immediately and I gave up shortly thereafter...but my interpretation doesn't matter...this is only my third season at the tram (and 5th year climbing anywhere), so I am probably a poor judge of the situation.

I appreciate that you've started a dialogue with the forest rangers/administrators. We all seem to agree that this is necessary...I'm happy to help in any way to obviate access issues.  I should also note, I was excited about the tram guide before it came out...anxious to explore all the probs I didn't know about, but I feel like I was naive about the magnitude of potential consequences.

We have problems with pad stashing, trashed landscapes where we boulder and many other issues that we could be more aware of as a community. What I am getting at, is that I used to climb at the Tram every weekend during it's seasons with maybe about 6 other climbers on the entire mountain with no issues with the rangers. We actually even bouldered with the rangers when they were off duty and messed around on their training apparatus. I guess you could say that we had a good relationship with them. Here in Colorado, the rangers are now aware that we as a community aren't doing what we should be doing as ambassadors of the outdoors. There is talk about no bouldering in Rocky Mountain National Park at all, that would suck!!!!!! The deal here is that we have already messed it up with the rangers by not policing ourselves among the climbing community. I would think that the these areas are more important than anybodies 8a.nu card. Talk to each other, do what is right for everyone that enjoys the mountain because keeping the rangers on your side is the best for everyone. If we don't abide by the rules, we won't have areas to enjoy kick ass rock climbing. Good luck and I hope the climbing community can come together to keep bouldering alive at the Tram for many years to come.";"f9666bd693b1cb01e554eea41711a5a8";"0";;"6tg2crtl";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

He told us that he has been looking over the bouldering areas, and he sounded impressed by how clean the areas actually are! So, if you have been bouldering at Tram, pat yourself on the back for that!! He also told us that, as a user group, boulderers have just as much right to be there as any other group, just as much as bird watchers have to watch birds, as hikers have to hike, and as boyscouts have to, uhh, scout boys. In fact, they actually want user groups like us up there using the park, thats what its there for. They have no intention of closing the place down to us, their primary function is to enforce the rules, and issue citations to those who break them. At worst, they'll just monitor us more closely, and issue more citations. Its my understanding that they have more trouble with other users. 

The fact that we can come together as a user group, organized, will be a bonus to us, not only here at Tram, but everywhere that we boulder. Even if our areas are mostly clean, showing up at this cleanup will have a positive impact with the state park system, and will demonstrate to them that we are concerned with keeping our impacts to a minimum, and that we are concerned with projecting a positive image for ourselves. 

I sincerely hope that we have a good turnout for this event. Because I think that thats what is going to impress the rangers the most. obviously, the more people that show up will mean that more of us care, and vice versa. We are going to try to finalize most of the details within the next couple of days, then we'll send out flyers and let everyone know what all we got going on.";"fbb51e3757730512d19f101cc6828dc5";"0";;"24yc18fv";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

I personally have no need to copy southern california bouldering information from your site, I have enough knowledge on this subject to, uhh, write books about it. heh!

If you're not listed above, hang in there ... I want to keep the user list small so I can manage the bugs coming in.  

If you *are* listed above, here are your instructions:

- make sure you're logged into the forum
- go to:  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://socalbouldering.com/problemdb/\">http://socalbouldering.com/problemdb/</a><!-- m -->
- start adding areas, problems, pics, comments, etc...  basically, treat the site as Live  (yes - all the data you enter will be saved for when it goes live)
- if you ever find an error or bug, click on &quot;HELP&quot; in the top right corner and let me know what happened.  please be as DETAILED as possible so I can track it down and fix it.
- depending on how buggy this code is, I'll start letting in more people, then eventually open it up to everybody.

The way the DB is setup is like this:  if an &quot;area&quot; (ex. Outback) has another area inside it, (ex. False Hueco Boulder), you can no longer add any problems to the other area (Outback).  This prevents Area from having areas AND problems.  It makes things much cleaner and easier to deal with.

I vote for &quot;Unnamed Boulder 1, 2, 3...&quot; ... if it's unclear where something is, you can search for it (faster anyways).

just my two cents...

When you submit a picture of a problem under a problem shouldn't it also show up in the pictures of the boulder or the area which the problem is located?

Also, I submitted a picture of White Rastafarian before I submitted the problem (because of that error).  Anyhow, I can't seem to move it to the page with the problem on it without resubmitted.  And I can't edit it.  Shouldn't I be able to edit my own photo?

Doesn't matter, i guess.  I think a pic of the area might be a nice big pic of the area.  For instance, the All Day boulder -- a shot from the trail, etc.  But for The One, a closer pic ...preferably someone on it, but there are no rules.  (great pic of The One, btw)

Something like...
V0 - 5 points
V1 - 10 
V2 - 20
V3 - 40
V4 - 80
V5 - 160
V6 - 320
V7 - 640
etc.

This puts quite a distance between a V2 climber and a V5 climber.  Granted this was for 5 best climbs.  If I'm not mistaken, this website is for best 25?  That really affects the scoring if the points go up incrementally.

To put it another way, if you had a true V5 climber who has does 25 V5s, that's 160 x 25 or 4000 points.  That's still less than someone who climbs one V10 (5120 points).";"79d478e025e7020acc677f6eaaedfb9a";"0";;"3ac8k43f";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

Most of the problems there are hard to find without a personal guide, and most require ropes.  The Tram is your best bet, but may be too far (although you [i:3di3ap0x]are[/i:3di3ap0x] considering Joshua Tree, which is farther).  Josh is gonna be way too hot unless you catch a good day.  You could pull a nighttime session there -- that's been known to happen.

Vista is no-man's land, unfortunately.

If I were you, I'd head to either a) the Tram (99% recommended), or b) if you don't want to make that drive, you can head to Santee Boulders (30 min south on I-15).  You'll usually find people there after work in the cooler hours during the summer.  Not nearly the quality or temps of the Tram, but much closer to where you'll be staying.

There's usually a large group of people from this board at the Tram each weekend, so no worries finding someone to show you around (right people?  right?).

Plus, I thought it would be cool for the community itself to know whats going on. 

The goal for the scorecards was to have something similar to 8a. In fact I tried really hard to get 8a. to do something specifically for SoCal. They said that would have to restructure their whole program to do something like that. One bonus for us with our scorecards is that we can get a concensus for ratings from people that have actually done the problems. Thats very cool, me thinks!

I feel the scoring system may not give you the grade concensus you are seeking. For example, if I feel a particular problem rated V9 is easy and I think it is V8, but I want to keep my score high I may call V9 to satisfy my fragile ego. I do not believe the scorecard and a true consensus database can coexist due to ego, but that is just my 3 cents. I will still use the database either way.

Either:
1. Deadpoint/jump to slot. - recommended
2. Fall into under cling/sidepull with right hand (scary looking flake around hip height) Stare at slot and deadpoint/jump.
3. If you are 6'5&quot; with + ape you can keep the heel but your IT Band might snap and hit you in the eye which you will need in order to see the slot you are throwing for - not recommended

Why is it so hard to believe that the entire internet is using a &quot;Home&quot; link on all of their pages, but in this case it is unnecessary. Dude add the link, simplicity is key. If I have to guess which of the 25 gif/jpegs gets me back to the home page then well uhhh the navigation does not work. I have an idea how about a big arrow pointing at the SOCAL PROBLEM DATABASE image referencing &quot;HOME&quot;.

And while I am on this rant why in god’s name does the Socal bouldering image on the forum take me to the forum? Should it not follow the laws above and take me home to Socalbouldering.com. Why in gods name would you want it left buried in the back of the browser windows? Where is the link to the real home page from the forum? If I want five pages to pop up to choose from I would go to a porn site, so I hear.

The whole reason you have navigation is to help the visitor NAVIGATE the website not discourage them from coming back.

Totally agree!!  I brought this up a while back and seem to recall that the response was that the homepage opens up a separate browser window/tab when you click on the forum.  Therefore, linking it back would open two pages of homepage unless you closed the first one.  My problem with this back then and still now, and probably Golfer's problem, is I do not navigate through the homepage but have a bookmark only for the forum.  Then, on occasion I check the homepage which in reality only changes every couple of days anyhow.  I vote for making the icon back to the homepage and if it just kills you then don't make the link to the forum open a new window.  Also, you already have a second way of getting back to the forum index by clicking the &quot;board index&quot; link so no harm there.

How do we decipher between sit starts at different grades on the database?  Some problems (i.e. Over the Boardwalk and Left hand) have different names for their sits but others (i.e. Chizam at the Sads) have 27 and a half variation sit starts each at their own grade.  

I say if it just has a stand and a sit we name then as such.  (i.e. Big Chicken, Big Chicken Sit-start)

But if they have several, how should we decipher?  Chizam really low sit?  Chizam V9 sit?

[/quote:28mfo6zl]
Agreed.  If you want to have multiple sits with the same name (Chizam Sit- V9, Chizam Sit- V10), go for it.  The names would be duplicated, but the grades will tell them apart.

Scott.  Chill.  Seriously.  Then read the posts above.  The breadcrumbs feature is something that is implemented on most of the ProblemDB, but not on some of the newer pages.  I'm working on it.  I cannot attend to every personal request as fast as you'd like as this is not my primary job that pays my bills.  Please consider that before being an ass.

Done.  The default setup for the forum's theme is to have the logo link to the forum root, therefore this was never done on purpose.  So sorry if this oversight has offended you.  And also sorry for the delay in ignoring your request for this feature a few months ago -- I've been a little busy working on the problem database.

Anyone stuck in town on Saturday should come out for free climbing and BBQ at the new gym.  Tons of good problems and routes to play on and some really good terrain to fall off of.  Gym opens at 10:00am.  Address is 6935 Arlington Avenue on the corner of Arlington and Airport in Riverside.

Miles fell throwing for the top, hit the edge of the pad, rolled his ankle off the edge, punctured a 2 inch bloody slash in the carpet with his exposed ankle bone, leaving his left foot stuck sideways to his shin and I'm sure some pretty agonizing pain throughout his leg.  

Not the best injury to see. Especially right before dinner. The wambulance came and picked him up and from what I'm told, he went into surgery that night to 'relocate everything' and inspect for further damage to his tendons and ligaments. He is supposed to be released into society on monday. 

Keep the guy in your thoughts and prayers as taking a ride in the meat wagon and going under the knife are not cheap, and taking time off of climbing always sucks not to mention severe pain is no day in the park.

Quick Question:
Besides maybe Jeff J, when was the last time John Gill,Bob Williams,Jeff Johnson,Paul Anderson,John Sherman,Eric Harrison,Mike Waugh,and Bob Kamps did Power Glide?


well
im going to have to defend Mike Waugh on you subtly calling him out and answer your question. i along with 5 others watched him bust out his trekking poles and hike the shit out of powerglide. this was less than 6 months ago.  but it doesnt matter because he doesnt take the v-scale seriously so he would be of no help for dimit or paul  because as mike would say &quot;ask john sherman that scale all started as a joke, john sherman didnt even know what vwhatever meant&quot;

I am curious about this sport boulderer phenomenon; do trad boulderers use a spotter? It seems to me a spotter is a pretty serious violation. A pad does not move to help break your fall. Do trad boulderers use special shoes to climb, that seems like cheating. Do trad boulders use anything to keep their hands from sweating?

Sorry for sharing.  Jesu Christo!!!  Dameat and I had to battle cause it was funny.

If anyone was offended by or didn't agree with the grades in Soul Cal or any of my vids, I send my deepest apologies.  <!-- swuss1 --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/11baby[1].gif\" alt=\"wuss1\" title=\"wussy\" /><!-- swuss1 -->  I do think a grade listed is better than not listed at all.

I went out mid-week last week and picked up a bunch of cigarettes up near greenpeace and several plastic bottles at the base of climbs in some other areas.  I'm guessing that this was climbers' trash since I picked the stuff up in areas that I doubt your normal gumbies are hiking around.

The problem is, that's not really true.  Previous managers have not had issues with many of the minor problems the current one does.  I can go back in the hold room and pick out at least ten holds that do not belong to the gym.  If theft is the issue, then they should realize that we don't need to bring in holds in order to make it easy to steal them.  We all have access to the back hold room.  I don't understand how hard it is to keep the inventory straight.  The holds Little T brought in are quite different and I could easily pick them out of a crowd.  Also, Rockreation puts RCM on the back of every hold in permanent marker.";"df538ae0ac194f625870a3be42daa4e1";"0";"wA==";"23621fk0";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

Thor, I am not really sure why you are complaining so much about Rockreation? You are there 4-5 times a week and Hanger and other gyms have been around for years. These gyms have had a better bouldering scene and terrain from Rockreation for years. I am sure the new Hanger is better than the old Hanger and Rockreation, but it is Riverside.

I do think for you young guys trying to work the comp circuit getting out and climbing at other gyms and with other boulderers is important. For me I just try to maximize the limited time I have to train, so I can drag my crippled old arse up a few blocs when I get a hall pass.

I would like Rockreation to be updated, but I can get what I need accomplished there without driving to BFE to train. With gas at $4 plus, I will not travel any farther than needed. If I am heading towards Riverside, then I will keep going to the Tram.

In regards to Miles, that is a big bummer and I hope he heals fast. It sounds like the pad was not the issue, but where the pad was placed before he started the problem. And for the most part poor spotting is not isolated to Rockreation. This is a gym wide problem.

Come on out and support SoCal’s bouldering community by cleaning up Tram. We’ll be meeting up at the Amphitheater next to the Ranger Station around 9:30am, but try to get there as early as possible to avoid too many pads on the Tram at once. We’ll prolly hand out raffle tickets around 10:am. Ranger &quot;in charge&quot; Kjer Sahl will be introducing herself. Dimitrius Fritz will be telling us about his climbing shoe recycling program. After that, go climb and clean at your pace. Well meet back at the Amphitheater at 4 or 5pm, turn in trash, do the raffle, then go party up at the Lounge. If everybody that says they are going to be there shows up (ahem!), it should be a pretty cool gathering!

We have some pretty cool stuff to raffle – 
Clothing from both Prana and Onsight 
A 1 month, and a 3 month free membership for Hanger 18 (either Hanger!)
1 Integrity 7 box set (5vids), plus a Soul Cal vid
Gift certificates for Evolve

And Shwag from both Black Diamond and from Flashed!
possibly even some free day passes to the Tram!

Currently, the ProblemDB only takes GPS in decimal format (34.01220, -116.16800).  However, Robert's guides have them in degree/decimal format (N34° 01.913 , W116° 09.007).

I added a little calculator to the &quot;Add&quot; and &quot;Edit&quot; screen.  Enter the degrees in one box, and the decimal in the other ... then hit &quot;Calculate&quot;.  The GPS decimal boxes above will be filled with the correct values.  When you're done, hit submit.

I'll try and add an automatic map that will show you what your GPS coordinates relate to...that'll have to be tomorrow.

I have lots of pics but the problem I have is that I haven't finalized which ones are included in the upcoming LA guide. I wouldn't want to use the same photos for both spots. Since I shoot only LA County spots, maybe I could find a few good pics to send over that I'm not using elsewhere...

I think you guys are doing fine. Shit. I think some of us get too personal to the site and start expecting a certain level without contributing ourselves...

I don't think we can expect the photos to refresh more than once a day.


anyways, have fun at the clean-up. I'll be out of town, but I do plan to do the Pine Mtn. thing... should be a good time.";"0593a392d2d6764c2d8b1cda85e51215";"0";"gA==";"1szi96t9";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

[quote:3luwykwo]I noticed a spike in the click-throughs last week.  Initially, I simply assumed that the advertisements had finally become relevant to our users -- for weeks, the adsense ads mentioned WoW gold, etc...nothing to do with rock climbing.  About the time the CTR numbers went up is when I noticed rock climbing-related ads.  

However, after talking to a few users, I believe something else may have happened.  This website is very small -- with about 100 uniques a day.  I recently added a new section to the website that took me months to complete.  I believe that a group of users, in a well-intended effort to say &quot;thank you&quot;, began to randomly click advertisements.  I have posted on the website's forum, instructing users to only click on ads that they are interested in, and also telling them &quot;no thanks&quot; to this behavior.  The post is here:

I will also remove the text &quot;Support The ProblemDB; Visit Our Advertisers&quot;  (an idea copied from the website &quot;DrudgeReport&quot;) -- just in case this is also encouraging random click-throughs.

There is nothing malicious going on -- just a few uninformed users of the site that think that a boat-load of click-throughs is a *helpful* thing.  I will make a concerted effort to reduce this kind of behavior and encourage the users to only click ads that are relevant and interesting to them.

This morning I awoke to find an email from Google Ad's saying that they have banned my account because of &quot;irregular&quot; activity.  

My only guess is this:  in an well-intended effort to say thank you for the ProblemDB, our users have been randomly clicking advertisements.  This spike in click-throughs has triggered Google to shut down my account (which in turn shuts down advertising on ALL sites that I run).  

While the gesture is nice, please refrain from clicking on any advertisements unless they interest you.  

I go now to the land of Google to request they turn my account back on.

Thanks, guys.

Details from Mercury News:

&quot;DYLLWILD, Calif.—Riverside County authorities say two rock climbers have been injured in a fall near Idyllwild—one critically.

Fire Capt. Timothy Bingham says the climbers were in the Suicide Rocks area on Saturday when the man fell more than 100 feet and suffered head injuries. Rescuers carried him about a mile to safety and he was airlifted to a hospital in critical condition.

Bingham says a woman who was tethered to the climber was injured by the force of his fall.

Two other climbers rescued her but the weather turned bad and they were pelted with hail as they repelled down a rock face with her.

The woman also was hospitalized but there was no immediate word on her condition.&quot;
_______________________________________________________________________


I did speak to Trevor's roommate this morning. Trevor is still in critical condition. He broke his C2 vertebra. He came out of a coma last night and was moving all limbs but they put him back into a drug induced coma. Claire broke her arm with the force of his fall, and has other minor injuries. She went home last night. 

Not sure about the details of exactly what went wrong. He was wearing a helmet, which apparently was cracked. Probably saved his life though.  

Many of you probably know Trevor from Rockreation where he works as belay staff, usually climbs with Donny and crew.  Claire, who has many years of experience climbing with her family, also started climbing at Rockreation within the past couple of years.  Please keep both of them in your thoughts and prayers.

Myself, golfer, and supafreaky couldn't find it that way either.  Chimney Rock is located *directly* behind the Ranger station, about 20 yds up-hill.  The problems face up-hill.

easier way to VP:

2) go to Ranger Station Rock area (where Trailside Tango is...about 30-40 yds on the trail west of the ranger station).  from there, proceed directly up-hill.  VP is located just below the huge summit rocks.

Directions are in the ProblemDB, too, along with GPS and a map:

We had around 50 people show up, with a few stragglers that we never even saw. It started out rough, we woke up to thunder and lightning. Then got to the Tram, and it broke down, they were turning peeps away at the base of the mtn. Everything worked out though. 

Special thanks to Jay and Kristen for driving all the way out there just to drop off prizes from their company Onsight Clothing. Also thanks to Drizzzz, for bringing a posse all the way down from Santa Barbara. Drizzz, where were you for the raffle?? you won a box set of vids from Integrity 7!!! heh, we switched you out for a Tram guide though. Thanks to Garrett too, for driving out solo and bringing climbit stuff. 

Thanks to all of the sponsors!! We had way more schwag than people. I think everyone left with several prizes, especially the Pheonix crew. They won so much stuff that they forfeited the grand prize, which was a Revolution crashpad. Even the Ranger Kjer won a pair of Madrock shoes and a chalkbag.

Messed around friday afternoon in the campground.  Gave a couple of tries to Boulder Basin Dyno, but couldn't commit to sticking it.  Tried to find &quot;Emperor's New Clothes&quot; to no avail.  

Ran into KK on Saturday at the Visor.  Finally managed to tick that one.  We then cruised up to Cracker Boy and played on that for awhile.

Saturday evening, I cruised around and ran into this problem.  Anyone know what it is?  (not in either guide).  From Pink Crack, walk North to the next cluster.  This problem lies just downhill and faces uphill.  Felt v3/v4-ish, but i couldn't tell at the end of the day.  <!-- s;) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s;) -->

I found this yesterday.  From Boneheads, walk east away from the campground.  A trail leads away from Way Too High.  Another small summit is located about 150 yds away.  Once you reach the base of this small summit, follow the trail around to the right.  On the opposite side of this area is VR, facing NE.

I have seen Head route setters get paid $10-16 per hour. For regular setters... quotas and salaries are another option. I dont personally think setters should get paid extra for stripping even though it can be a bitch.

I recommend talking to people on routesetter.com and particularly Chris Danielson.

- lead route = 2 hours
- top rope = 1 hour

So if you're a fast setter, you only have to work as long as it takes you and still get paid the full amount. 

As far as stripping, other gym employees or the head setter should take care of this. We used to have people do it for trade. There is nothing less motivating as a setter coming in to set and seeing the wall completely full and no space. Stripping and setting in one session can bum out the setter and leave them less inspired. So the route quality going up there after may suffer from lack of motivation. 

Clean wall space, and clean holds will inspire the setters which should in turn bring better routes. . . . (as long as the setters know what there doing)

A college I set at pays $15 hour.
A couple other gyms I've set at have payed $20 to $35 per route. And usually there is a difference between boulders and routes. 

For resetting a massive area, sometimes a flat fee is easier. 

Also I think experience plays a huge roll in the pay scale.

Hey wrong thread asshole!

Is it just me or does ~$10 an hour seem really freakin cheap for a head course setter. I was making $10 an hour when I was 15 years old working at the <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.adventureplex.org\">www.adventureplex.org</a><!-- w --> climbing wall clipping kids into auto belays all day. I think head setters should get AT LEAST $15 an hour seeing as the quality of all the climbing in a gym is based on their skills.

I flashed some black people at the gym yesterday too. Oh wait... what did you say?

Anyways... I think there should be some system to pay setters based on their production rate as well as their quality. Nothing bothers me more than people who spend four hours on one route that get paid the same as when I set four routes in the same amount of time. However, at the same time I hate it when a system is in place that pays based solely on production and people turn out  a bunch of shitty routes real quickly.";"bb5e7b65f42ff6573e981ae662c37c08";"0";"gA==";"1m6lrj35";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

Yep that's right - 12 FUCKING MONTHS!!   <!-- s:evil: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_evil.gif\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil or Very Mad\" /><!-- s:evil: --> 
It has been confirmed the Areas of West Camino Cielo Road which contain The Playground, Brickyard and Lizard's Mouth are officially closed for the next 12 months do to Hydro-Asstro- Mulch being dumped on potential Gap Fire erosion areas. The map above shows the official closed area. A violation of this prohibition is punishable by a fine of not more than $5,000 for an individual or $10,000 for an organization, or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. 16 USC 551 and 18 USC 3559, 3571, and 3581. (Translation: Unless your G-Funk and you save $5,000 a year living in a van down by the river, then you should probably stay out of The Yard)

Hydromulch will be applied by aircraft to about 1500 acres in the Gap Fire area. Hydromulch is an all-organic mix of paper/wood fiber, water and a binding substance. It helps hold the soil in place to minimize erosion, trap moisture and create an environment in which the native seeds and roots already present in the soil can sprout. The green dye in the hydromulch helps the pilots see where they have made their drops, but the color will fade to a light brown within a short period of time. Treatments are scheduled to begin on September 24 and will take 3-4 weeks to complete. The treated areas will be closed to all public entry for the first year to protect the hydromulch cover.

Wrong. The kid lives on some private property in Nuevo with a pretty good size boulder field maybe 60 boulders, 25ish with potential climbing. So I went out to scope the scene with some brushes and other developing tools expecting some gnar gnar choss pile. 

I have only gone twice now and with Dom, Joe, and some other buds and we have a good start on what could quite possibly be some pretty cool bouldering. I got pics I'll post them up soon.

1. What is the best way to find out the name or rating of a specific problem when the guide you have (dr. topo for blk. mt.) has it listed as &quot;unknown&quot; or &quot;unnamed&quot;?

2. Why would there even be a problem, say at a V4&amp; V6 level that is &quot;unnamed&quot; but theres V1-V3s' that have been named?

3. Is it the person who sets the problem or the person with the FA that names the problem (I realize sometimes its the same person)?

I know that dr.topo is a 1/2 completed guide made in like 7 days but it pretty much the only thing I could find to make my way around Blk.Mt.
 
4. is there a better guide for this area? (besides Joe) LOL

For the cheater version: reach into the crevice on the left to a &quot;hidden&quot; jug, heel hook right (near the small pocket), then reach down right hand into the small pocket at the lowpoint of the cave, fighting to keep your shoulder from leaning against the boulder behind (or letting it?). Form there drop both feet onto the low shelf and reach around to the jug on the other side of the lowpoint. 

For the more aesthetic version: get a little swing going and shoot your left foot to a toe hook in the jug on the other side of the lowpoint of the cave. Then bring your left hand down into the small pocket, drop both feet down to the shelf (harder if you're shorter!), then bump right hand to a sloper dish and then around to the jug on the other side. 

For the finish move right hand to a fin above the fin with the mono hole in it. Then bring your left hand up and undercling the fin with one finger in the mono. Reach big with the right hand to a jug.

That is the coolest comment ever.  One of my climbing buddies hates JTree and would rather hit the Tram any day over Josh.  But that's cuz he can't climb slab, friction-based climbs, can't stem and sucks at mantling.  He's almost a pure gym rat.

I am reciting the consensus rating from over 30 years of people climbing the thing. You don't call Full Service V11, you don't call High Plains Drifter V8, and you don't call So High V6. This isn't 8a.nu, you can't just go around throwing out any number you feel like. 

So High wasn't even the point of my rant. I was bashing the article itself, the person who wrote, and the magazine that published it. These people in the media should be obligated to report accurate information. Are we really going to respect Lisa for climbing a V6 more than a V5...please.

1. What is the best way to find out the name or rating of a specific problem when the guide you have (dr. topo for blk. mt.) has it listed as &quot;unknown&quot; or &quot;unnamed&quot;?

2. Why would there even be a problem, say at a V4&amp; V6 level that is &quot;unnamed&quot; but theres V1-V3s' that have been named? 
[b:3srs3h0j]no one named it or whoever did the guide didn't know the name. it seems as though there would be a better answer to this question, but there's not really. and it's not always right to equate a higher difficulty with the 'classic-nesss' of a problem[/b:3srs3h0j]

3. Is it the person who sets the problem or the person with the FA that names the problem (I realize sometimes its the same person)? 
[b:3srs3h0j]depends... someone else can tackle this one...[/b:3srs3h0j]

4. is there a better guide for this area? (besides Joe) LOL
[b:3srs3h0j]I think we can expect a guide for Black from Chaz Wilson in the future. For now, you'll have to make due with the books we have, such as the Craig Fry guide.

-- Ask folks.  Forum topic?  <!-- s:? --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" /><!-- s:? -->  Google....I usually rely on rtm's guides when it comes to JTree and the Tram. However note that rtm is compiling info from many sources so the grades may not be accurate.  In terms of rating, my best example is Turnbuckle out in Turtle Rock.  Guide - V3, Online consensus at rockclimbing DOT com - V2, Dr. Topo - V1.  My opinion - V1.  So if you really want a grade for a problem you're working, research common sources. As for Black Mtn I have no idea; maybe rtm will complete his trilogy of guidebooks by adding Black Mtn to the list.  then they can make a movie out it with skydiving hobbits and orks FA'ing V17.  <!-- sjoe1 --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/biggrinjester[1].gif\" alt=\"joe1\" title=\"wiseguy\" /><!-- sjoe1 --> 


2. Why would there even be a problem, say at a V4&amp; V6 level that is &quot;unnamed&quot; but theres V1-V3s' that have been named?

-- Some people are lazy?  It's about having fun really, not about naming problems or grading.  But names and grades should be given as a point of reference.  Now instead of wondering why it's unnamed...give it a name!  If the person who FA'ed didn't bother, then do the rest of us a favor and name it!  Let the rest of the world dispute it if they want.  It's more important to have an easily accessible reference to it so others can enjoy it too, and having a name is a key aspect to that.


3. Is it the person who sets the problem or the person with the FA that names the problem (I realize sometimes its the same person)? 

-- From what I've seen and do myself, you can simply leave unestablished projects unnamed until you send them or name it yourself at project status, either way is acceptable.  For example of the latter, I believe Sharma dubbed The Flame &quot;Flamignon&quot; before he actually completed the problem (please correct me if I am wrong about that).  However the prior appears to be more common practice.  Me, it depends on if I'm really psyched about the route. If not, I'll call it &quot;Project&quot;. If so I'll give it a name.  Otherwise you may have a situation like your #2 question (sweet route with no name).  But in the end, I believe the person who gets the FA reserves the right to name it and grade it.

Alright so I can get to the crux span easily and have stuck it twice. My problem here is that I'm at full extension, with my right hand still holding the upper crack of the first section, left fingertips on the the lowest section of the upper flake, left leg either tangling or flagged and right foot on the lower of the top two jugs of the first section.  Crossing over with the right hand at this point is extremely difficult as I don't have much wiggle room to turn my shoulders

- Is there somewhere at that point to establish the left foot? That would help me get my right foot up to the next jug, which in turn would give me wiggle room to turn my shoulders for the crossover?

- should I just do a short dyno to the portion of the big flake just past the lowest part (the gaston)?  Is it juggy enough?

like eveyone knows where bellyflop is and where boulder basin dyno is but that short overhanging unnamed V4 in between has no name so you have to say &quot;its between this and this just down from this&quot;. 

oh well ill get around, and ill see if i can add to the database here aswell

On the flip side, if you want to draw your own map, do it.  And upload it as a picture.

I hate to miss out on an opportunity to climb outside just because no one wants to go.

On the flipside. I find it to be rather peaceful, a mini sabbatical if you will.  Getting away from everyone, got the iPod, hiking through the desert or mountains; it's pretty sweet.  Of course this also limits what problems I get to work on.  For example I'd never do Emerald City by myself but the Cube or Methane both have relatively flat G-rated landings.

The cell phone trick doesn't work too well in Josh.  If i go out alone in Josh, i try to take a radio with me.  It ain't much, but it's a better shot than waiting for a cell tower to go up near me while i'm bleeding to death.

I've done Josh plenty of times for the same reasons...I typically find it harder to get motivated, but the peace/relaxation factor is nice.  I try to change up my expectations on the day -- work on some problems, don't worry about sending, just have a good time and chill.

There was a rough, inaccurate guide on Dr. Topo and it seemed easiest to adapt it, rather than starting from scratch. I also liked that it would be available online for free. It was never meant to be anything other than something that I through together. I didn't formally get consensus for the grades and I didn't include any of the new areas because: 1) I didn't know them as well 2) new problems were going up every weekend. I assumed someone else or I would update it again. Then I decided to break my thumb and go off to grad school which took me out of the picture. 

The answers to your questions:
1) There are so many unnamed problems because there are many problems that haven't been named. The original SoCal Bouldering Guide has circles for boulders and B grades. Only a few of the old problems were given names in the guide and that is how most of us learned about the area. I've climbed with a number of people who have been climbing there since the dawn of time (at some point in the late 80's) and they don't use names other than the ones given. Besides it's fun to say &quot;have you done the problem around the corner from the big boulder with a seam on the left side?&quot; To really get people rilled up, I'll confess that I got sick of writing &quot;unnamed&quot; so I made up a few. 

2) Sometimes people named V2s and they didn't name V6s. 

3) It's usually the FA, but sometimes projects get names too. Dark Horse was the Arnauld Special after one person who used to work on it in the mid 90's. 

4) I wish. Someone should kick Chaz in the ass or steal his notes and do it themselves.

The DB saves all the comments... is there a particular page you're seeing where comments are getting cut off?

Nope.  Comments are tied to their particular area or problem.  Mingling the two is not ideal.  It may make sense in the example you make, but on a global scale, it will make the area sections difficult to manage.";"110416cb41671090bbe4f2cbcca690b0";"0";"gA==";"mghu3grh";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

I think you gotta look at the audience; I believe people overall prefer and will thus buy the guidebooks.

At the Tram Emerald City and Shades of The Old School are Great but I don't think the nearly unlimited potential for slab problems at The Tram has begun to be tapped.";"78da6519591beec54075b31ae71f3de4";"0";;"3la3aufp";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

The hike in can take awhile (i usually hike to the top and hit problems on my way down).  It can be hard to find problems there if you're new, and a lot of the problems have bad landings.  However, there are some great problems on killer stone.

Santee has much easier access, but the stone is not as nice.  Most problems are incredibly slick.  Get ready for *thin* crimps and dime edging.  There's a few climbs in your range, Brady, that haven't seen repeats lately (Suzy's Discharge, sandbag v6).  My favorite rock is the &quot;20 Pt Boulder&quot;

Drove back, dropped off my buddy and spent 5 hours in the ER for blunt force trauma to the chest and breathing pain.  I would have to say this was a total accident, though my spotter decided it best to stand on the side of the rock that I didn't hit...  <!-- sjoe1 --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/biggrinjester[1].gif\" alt=\"joe1\" title=\"wiseguy\" /><!-- sjoe1 -->

try this beta - after the big move left to the gaston, heel hook right, next to your right hand. then match hands at the gaston, rise up on the right heel, then cross left high into the flake. If you get high enough into the flake, its quite juggy.

If you haven't been to the tunnel boulders come on down. It's a quality area with a few FAs to be had still. very good rock quality with some classic lines up to v7/8. one water landing FA waiting.
If enough peeps want to go, maybe we can do both the creek and the tunnel boulders. wished I had some cool gifts to give everyone for coming, but all I can offer is maybe a beer or two and great LA bouldering.

We could be completely wrong but I thought it best to bring this up in the forum so that someone more knowledgable could chime in and confirm the foot feature's prior existence or if it was a modification.

Hmmm...the grade. Tough call.  I've only done one other v6 - The Visor.  I thought it was similarly difficult.  

But then, 5 minutes later, i hopped on Johnson Arete (which has a consensus of v7 right now) and did it on my second go. Very strange. I thought Power Glide was much harder.  Now I'm confused.  Is Power Glide sandbagged or is Johnson Arete super soft?  If either, you'd think the consensus grades would answer that question...but they don't.

The database is user-driven for many reasons.  The first is to set consensus grades and star-ratings on problems.  The second is that the database will be far more full than if only rTm or myself tried to enter in every single problem.

The down-side to a user-driven database like this is that some people get lazy and enter in crappy descriptions or no directions.  It's up to the community to comment on a particular area and hope someone sees that comment and comes to the rescue.    

Maps are provided via the GPS data. It's up to the submitter to provide this.  Drawings of maps can be drawn by the user and submitted just like any other picture.

As the DB grows up a little bit, I think we'll see the descriptions get a little bit more love and the pictures and maps fill out nicely.  This thing has only been around for about 3 months so far, so be patient.

cheers.

However my buddy nmon was arguing against that based on what a mutual friend told him; the offwidth is off-route, with the intended line being up the horizontal cracklines, then traverse right to the topout.

I'm not accepting that since he's a consistent V4 climber yet wasn't able to send using either sequence, indicating that the use of the offwidth still warrants a V4 rating (with the SDS). However the problem description indicates the use of the cracklines and doesn't mention the offwidth.

We have introduced much more of a design element into these newer designs, as well as added performance gear, and organics. Our goal is to really expand our line so that everyone can find a use for at least one of our products. We strive to select the most comfortable shirts, shorts, pants, etc so that while people are doing what they love to do (whether that be climbing, lounging, spooning, etc) they are as comfy as can be. We have been working with a couple of superb photographers in the valley, and have been amassing models and throwing them in front of the camera. The plan is to release a catalog that people all over the country (and beyond!) will be able to order through us in 3 ways: online, web, mail &amp; phone - that's 4 actually, so hooray for us! It will be chock full of beautiful models showcasing the gear, even more new products (mostly tees), some small ads, and possibly even some hardware (biners, slings, shoes, etc). 
    We are also in talks with a couple different climbing teams in the Southwest about a team sponsorship agreement. We have decided that we would rather not single out climbers, and would rather use our name and products to help build the sport in a very positive way. For us climbing is about the lifestyle of it - the people involved, the inert freedom that comes naturally with it, living and being outside the box mentally and physically. Therefore, we feel that building an entire team up is greater than just singling out an individual. 

Any feedback? Please post!!!

Then why are there so many damned &quot;unnamed&quot; problems in the guidebook?  Is it now someone's job to run through each guidebook and make up shitty names for every unnamed problem?  Are we now creating a &quot;name that problem&quot; gold rush?

Don't open the floodgates, man.  Shit, most of the unnamed problems are unnamed because they're chossy, 0-star, VB's.  They're meant to be unnamed.  I hate referring to problems as &quot;unnamed 1&quot; and &quot;unnamed 2&quot;, but who's to say who has the right to name them?  We'll end up with a mixed bagged of names.  How do we then decide who's name to go with?  Can't we just refer to it as &quot;the shitty v0 next to Turnbuckle&quot;?

But that's the parent's decision -- not yours.  The rights here go to the person that did the FA.  If they left it unnamed, that's there choice.  

You don't go around naming other people's kids for them...and you don't name people's boulder problems.  If you want to give it a name for you and your friends, knock yourself out...in the meantime, since it's not your problem, it's &quot;unnamed&quot; ... and you'll just have to continually reference it as &quot;that v0 by turnbuckle.&quot;  

I am in no way the &quot;expert&quot; on these things, but I've been around long enough to know that this is a long-standing tradition and one that is here to stay.  Should the FA'er have named the problem for ease of reference?  Maybe ... but again, their choice.

cheers.

November 1, 2008 Great warmup problem.  This arete has been climbed so many times by God knows how many people.  If anyone knows the original name please let me know so I can change it.  Otherwise I'm assuming it was unnamed until my buddy Evan decided we should call it &quot;Assburgers&quot; LOL~

November 2, 2008 Which means it should remain &quot;unnamed&quot;, don't you think?

November 2, 2008 if you didnt FA it i would forget about trying to name it.
  

I agree that the FA'er reserves the right to name the problem, absolutely. Otherwise why not make the effort to reduce the number of &quot;unnamed&quot; problems in the world?  Especially for instances where we don't know or may never know who FA'ed?  A lot of you guys have been in it longer than me so maybe there's an understanding about leaving problems/routes &quot;unnamed&quot; (maybe out of respect for the Stone Master who FA'ed it?)?  For someone as myself who hasn't been in it as long, I just don't see the reason in leaving the &quot;unnamed&quot; unnamed.  <!-- s:( --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /><!-- s:( -->

So Mulligan and his crew left the problem unnamed.  Then some time later Obe comes along, sends it, and now it's called the Obe Problem.  I don't think Obe's intention was to dis on Mulligan.

Ok...well I could be totally wrong as I just met the guy recently...but Mulligan doesn't come off as being snide nor arrogant.  Perhaps a person who is like that would do so in an effort to be a jerk?  He seems like a pretty mellow guy, so if he left it unnamed I would assume he probably did so with no 'ill intentions'.   In any case, I don't think like that so it's difficult to comprehend why someone would waste the opportunity.........just to piss off some future climber?  <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: --> NAW~

Hey now, remember that was my buddy's name for it.  C'mon...&quot;Assburgers&quot; is pretty stellar compared to &quot;Unnamed&quot;, yeah?  And what if it's not in the guidebook, such as this one?

Anyway ma bad, lemme attempt to rebut your points....no I don't think it was a douche move because (I don't think) he was doing it to lay claim...I don't think Obe meant any harm, thus it's not really a douche move.

Nothing gave him the right to name the problem.  But with that, Obe doesn't get the nod for the FA, Mulligan does. But then again some Tram problems have multiple FA's AND multiple names so even that point is arguable. However your issue begs the question; does a person need the right to name an Unnamed problem if the FA'er chose to forfeit their right to naming it at the time of the FA?  I think by leaving it Unnamed it means they chose to forfeit that right.

He says leave it as-is since JTree has generations of history and that nothing out there hasn't been climbed at least once.  Plus there's a level of credibility associated to it.

The old days had way fewer people out bouldering and seldom if ever was there a guidebook to an area. The reasons were simple - little to no market, no real need and with time spent bouldering with locals at an area one would quickly get to know the problems and their locations. It was common for boulder problems not to get named, and mainly because it didn't matter to them (usually the only problems that did get named were super classic and/or hard). What you ended up with was areas with a few named problems and lots and lots of unnamed problems which was fine if you were given a tour or just showed up and starting pulling, but it made it hard to talk about problems without much to reference to (imagine trying to give directions to your house if none of the streets had names).

Guidebooks changed all that and made it easier to get the information to the masses as well as start to catalog the problems at an area. Slowly over the years names were added to problems and boulders. Look at the older SoCal Bouldering Guide (Fry) for an example of an older style guidebook and then look how things have evolved from a simple overhead topo with nameless ratings to the present JT Guide with it's nice photo topos, named problems and even GPS coordinates. 

Robert has stated he doesn't particularly like unnamed problems but still they exist in his guides because often times it can feel like a chore to have to give names to so many problems. Why not get some names on the problems and move on to more important things like picking up trash and maintaining access, and if the &quot;real&quot; name become known we can always change it. Just think - there's some kid out there who going to do his first V-whatever and he'll be psyched to have climbed a problem - a problem with a name.";"b9ae1d429700c3c45a0d58ce29f1a062";"0";;"1x0vh8i3";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

You wake up and make her breakfast in bed and then prepare her a nice warm bath (with the requisite candles scattered around the room).  Any and all demands of your child should be handled 100% by you.  You take the baby over to a prearranged overnight sitter (parents?) and have a nice drive to Upland with your wife, speaking only of your everlasting love and adoration of her and of how lucky you are to have her in your life (DO NOT under any circumstances talk about climbing - not a word!).  She then watches her man climb, realizes how lucky she is to have you, and commits herself to the relationship all over again.  The comp ends in time to check into a local hotel and clean up for a nice, romantic, kid-free dinner.  Then back to the hotel to consummate your new commitment to each other.

Really, you're lack of imagination and creativity here is troubling...

A group of 9 (yes nine!) climbers rate something V8 and one climber rates it V6 (sandbagger  <!-- s:evil: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_evil.gif\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil or Very Mad\" /><!-- s:evil: -->)
Consensus grade: V8-  doesn't make as much sense.

Wouldn't it be better after a certain number of senders post a grade to take the mode?  Or maybe throw out the two outliers?  If it's a consensus then shouldn't the mass silence a sole minority?

First off, I haven't posted very much in the everything else forum and have started no pointless thread wars.  Second, I have no problem with someone posting about how Aron is a dork, but to post anything like that as their first post and give no explanation or identity seems cowardly and agenda driven.  Even if I do know you and would be cool with it in person, you have to assume we don't know you and that it comes off kinda dickish.  I can't count the number of times rtm or fraction have made fun on Aron on this site if I used my fingers and toes.  But that doesn't bother me, and it probably doesn't bother Aron because a) I know them and I know they're not serious and b) they might be right, ha!  So buddy, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt but just keep in mind how it comes off as your first post.  And if you want to bag on people then expect some recourse.  And seriously do I know you?  Is cm, Costa Mesa?  

But anyhow, it seems the tribe has spoken on this one, so in an attempt to keep the mood light and fun here is my contribution :

I'm fine changing up the math a little bit.  Right now, it's a simple average.  What's fair?   After 5 recorded sends, we drop the highest and lowest, then average?  Should we wait until 7 or 8 sends?

...or should we do something different?  (I ruled at calculus, I sucked at statistics)";"a81ec85221a8cec2ececc2d06a3ef66f";"0";;"3o4uk5sx";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

If we drop the two outliers at 5 that means we are only taking the average of 3 sends.  I say at least wait until we have 7 sends.  Somewhere between 7-10. 

I'm curious though, at what point when taking an average does the outlier not change the + or - of a problem?
For instance, V5 V5 V4 would average 4.667 so is that a V5- or V4+ or just a V5?";"3249e3d18d95e8f0a0fed00caf9d069e";"0";;"12u9miup";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

Maybe when the decimal is at .8 or .9?  At 7.97 it's probably safe to round up to V8-.  Even at 7.8 it's still reasonable.  but at 4.667, probably V4+.  if it's 4.97, then V5-

Have you considered weighted average?  with V5 V5 V4 the weighted average is 4.8 which if rounded goes to V5-.  The weight I used was the number of times a rating was given, which I think makes sense as it indicates grade consistency.

Though ideally outliers (sandbaggers!) should be tossed, statistically they should be normalized.  However what normalization constant to use is beyond me and normalizing is probably too complicated given the context.  

I do believe gross outliers should be removed.  Though a while back this was mentioned (maybe just an email between me and fraction) about a given situation &quot;what if a really tall guy came in and rated everything V0?&quot;.  Then we're taking consensus on a problem with that V0, which is not ideal given a current average rating of, say, V5.  Maybe it would be best to remove outliers when the grade given is more than 2 off from the rating with the greatest weight?  That would remove gross outliers but not sandbaggers.";"217743b8fc3dc8ef2493eca39e2573e6";"0";;"1rfw8c5k";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

With weighted average, I did some number crunching using weighted vs standard mathematical average.  Not much change but appears to be more accurate.  So let's say we give ratings a weight of the number of times it's been entered...

Example:
&quot;Unnamed&quot; (LOL~) gets V5 V5 V4

mathematical average: (5 + 5 + 4)/3 = 4.67 (rounded) == V4+ or arguably V4

weighted average:
rating     weight
5           2 (since it was given 2 times)
5           2
4           1

== (sum[(rate*weight)])/(sum of weights)
== (5*2) + (5*2) + (4*1) / (2 + 2 + 1)
== (24)/(5)
== 4.8
== V4+, arguably a V5-

So lets see this with Stretch's example, 9 V8 and 1 V6 for &quot;Fraction's Superman Crimpfest&quot;

math average: (72 + 6) / 10 == 7.8 == V7+, arguably V8- 

weighted average:
rating     weight
8           9
8           9
...
6           1

== (8*9) + ... + (8*9) + (6*1) / (9 + ... + 9 + 1)
== (72) + ... + (72) + (6) / (82)
== (654) / 82
== 7.98 (rounded)
== V7+, but rounded V8-

So it's still a V8- but the calculated average is much more reflective of the number of instances concentrated at V8.  

Though one sandbag exists, we're still doing consensus so we gotta count it, right?  So when does it go from sandbags to outright outlier?  That's what I was saying about maybe excluding ratings that are more than 2 away from rating with the greatest weight.  If someone adds a V5 rating, it gets tossed as &quot;majority vote&quot; already puts it at V8.  

Then again you could argue for excluding on more than 1 away. This would automatically toss the V6 above, which intuitively makes sense when you already have 9 people voting for V8, right?  Now if that was a V7 instead of V6, that might fly...

== (72) + ... + (72) + (7) / (82)
== 655 / 82
== 7.99 rounded == V7+/V8-

But you still get the V8- with one versus consensus.  Maybe consider excluding in the calculation any rating that does not have at least one-third the weight of the rating with the most weight.  so in this instance there would have to be at least 3 people voting on V7 for V7's to get included in the calculation.

Anyway this is all just something to consider...disclaimer --- double check the math!  <!-- sjoe1 --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/biggrinjester[1].gif\" alt=\"joe1\" title=\"wiseguy\" /><!-- sjoe1 -->";"94a2fc31e45c117fac3dd42b74d56d87";"0";;"sqjq9y4p";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

However I wouldn't hard-code the point at which this occurs (after x or y number of sends). You could get 6 guys all saying V9 then one sandbagger saying V5 and that V5 gets stuck in the calculation.  Counting the most commonly given grade, ie using a weight, allows this to happen in real-time.  So even if you get V5 V4 V3 V2 V0 for &quot;Stretch's 5150 Traverse&quot;, they all get a weight of one...then all you need is one more person to provide a matching rating of say, V3.  Then the calculation happens with V4 V3 V3 V2, automatically excluding V5 and V0.  Later you could get a couple of V5's, so then it becomes V5 V5 V5 V4.

Second topic:  (beware, radical idea coming) How opposed would everyone be to ditching -/+'s altogether?  Actually having a decimal-based V-scale?  There is no &quot;V5-&quot;, but V4.8.

out there, i know.  this is something that Mulligan actually talked to me about when he and Robert discussed the DB in years-past.  Sensei's argument was that he was sick of seeing stuff shuffled around so much between V-grades (it's a 4 there, a 5 there), that a definitive database with decimals would fix it.

i've got a request into a friend for a bit of math that will present a weighted mean based on the total number of ticks on a problem.  Therefore, the more ticks a problem has, the more weight is given to same grades.  (google &quot;Bayesian filters&quot;).

when i get it built, i'll incorporate it into my rebuild of the ProblemDB. 

re: decimals, i'll probably present both:  a straight V/-/+ grade as well as the decimal (so you can see how close/far it is from the next grade).

thanks for your help, guys.

I've heard comments before that got me wondering about the consistency of grades w.r.t. the area you're climbing.  Some examples of those are &quot;it's relative to the place&quot; and &quot;everything is sandbagged&quot;, etc. etc. so what's the deal?  In the end we know what really matters is how hard and fun the problem is, but some clarification would be cool.  Examples:

- &quot;Everything V3 and below in JTree is sandbagged&quot;.  Most of us tend to agree JTree is sandbagged, but is that really the case or is it the type of climbing/stone that JTree has to offer vs other places like the Tram?  Is it that JTree actually has more consistent ratings based on what is now considered &quot;classic ratings&quot;?

- Here's an interesting one; &quot;In JTree I can only do V4-V5 but in Bishop I can send V8&quot;.  Got this from a JTree local. Again is JTree really sandbagged that bad, OR does Bishop have a number of overrated problems?

[quote=&quot;fraction&quot;:c3vkhw2g]It's called &quot;The Eppulator.&quot; Word has it that the grade it was given coincides with typical Woodson grades -- the FA was done when 5.12 was the hardest ... thus the 5.12/v4 grade. probably v7 or harder, but can't find anyone who has actually sent it recently (although plenty that have tried)[/quote:c3vkhw2g]
...does that mean The Eppulator is really V4? or is that V4 &quot;oldschool&quot; or &quot;classic&quot; ratings&quot;?  

Have ratings over time become diluted such that the bar has been lowered?  Or is it to reflect the difficulty of hard climbs/problems, with the side affect being older problems being falsely upgraded?  Or are problems now more accurately graded than previously thought?

This all kinda makes me wonder what a V0 in Hueco is vs. a V0 at the Tram... <!-- s:confused: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/headscratch[1].gif\" alt=\":confused:\" title=\"confused\" /><!-- s:confused: -->";"ac3d05a9ae60d52f565a1ec706be7a34";"0";"gA==";"c3vkhw2g";"1";"1227807463";;"718";"1";"0"

Maybe thats naive. 

The rest of the climb from what I remember is missing little patches of rock so it probably happened during it falling out of the wall or its as a result of 140-180 lb. people prying on them. Thats the nature of problems that don't get hundreds or thousands sends a winter, especially in Josh. Lots of things break and some by purpose. If you walk up to a raw piece in of rock in Josh and want to climb it stuff usually comes off, unless you are rtm and you find 20% of the five star problems.

Chiseling? Are people still doing that?

Guns?

And rare and elusive? Are we kidding here?

Aron is always doing the chicken dance up the boulder (of course much better then I can with or without the wing effect) and gun,  well sorry brother but you are going to have to get one of those Hulk costumes. It is not in your genetics. Keep flapping the wings and sending all my projects.

I was driven by grades. &quot;I want to climb V3, then V4&quot; so on and so on. It has only been in the last month or so that I climbed my first V8 and did not get an overwhelming joy from it!? So I sat back and asked myself why. I came to the conclustion that If I seek out harder and harder problems,It will continue to get harder.
 As of late Ive tried to seek out very appealing Problems. Last sunday I got on The coolest Boulder Problem I've been on to date and while sending it I was having fun and feeling the overwhelming joy I was craving from harder problems. The problem I was on was a V5 and Ive been more stoked to go climb it again than that V8. So I figure if I really worry about seeking out the problems that appeal to me, I will come along problems in the mid to upper range and have just as much fun projecting and sending them as I do problems in the mid to lower range.

Stoney is pretty cool. I like it because its sandstone, and I get sick of climbing granite all the time.

The only thing that sucks about Stoney is the oldskoolers that have climbed all 50 problems 100,000 times each and have them ruthlessly wired, then go around spraying how easy they are.

Well...check the comments on that problem.  plasticmullet disagrees with the v5 I gave it.  The beta I used felt like v4/5, but if plasticmulle tsays v2 and the guide says 5.10+, I probably used some harder-than-necessary beta (typical for me <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P --> )

I could bash on this guy if I wanted, I just don't see the point.  If he's new and everyone bashes on him for his ignorance, he may get turned off to climbing altogether or it may give him a bad impression of the people in our climbing community.  Every climber I have ever met has always been cool, laid back, encouraging and helpful.  I don't mind passing that along to anyone when the opportunity arises.  I think bashing is ok as long as you know them personally and they understand that it's all just for fun and a form of male bonding.  I'm glad there are those of us who would rather encourage than discourage, and who welcome the opportunity to meet and climb with new people, noob or stone master. And if some climber, ANY climber, has questions about shit that I can answer, then I will.

Unfortunately there's the other side of this....it's unfortunate that some think it's so *cool* to talk shit to people who are new at it, who are trying to make new friends in the climbing community, or who have questions about things they are ignorant about.  Seriously, if you don't know someone personally (or at all) and they didn't say or do anything intentionally bad or wrong to you or anyone else, where THE FUCK do you get off being a dick to them?!?!  I don't know this guy, but I don't think he said anything wrong so fuck yeah i'm willing to come to his defense!  And if he pissed some of you off...[b:2qok4mow]PLEASE GET THE FUCK OVER IT![/b:2qok4mow]  You were [b:2qok4mow]ALL[/b:2qok4mow] noobs at one point so you know how it feels.

I would like to apologize for the somewhat abusive tone of my prior message. In an effort make ammends I would like to say that generally the ground in Joshua Tree is sandy and recepetive to tent staking. If the ground is too hard to accept your tent stakes perhaps you should find another location for your tent. Another option is to buy better, more sturdy tent pegs and bring a sledgehammer in case the ground proves to be a bit firm. It is also possible to tie a rope to your tent corners and lash them to a nearby rock. I hope you get answers to all your queries and send many kick ass boulder problems during your one and only trip ever to Joshua Tree. Again bad form on my part and hopefully I have helped to quell some of your tent staking concerns. Have a wonderful trip and enjoy your camping experience.";"0cf37ec0420eff70e408d48bbaf13f35";"0";;"1sbrrmxn";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

i intend to visit hidden valley campground for caveman area and stem gem. after which i intend to head to real hidden valley for JBMF and Turtle rock area. where can i park? do i park at hidden valley campground and then walk to real hidden valley or drive and park near hidden valley?

i also want to visit the cap rock 2 area. do i park there or walk over?[/quote:z9q6fp34]

For Caveman and Stem Gem, park in the Intersection Rock day parking -- located just north of Intersection Rock.  From here, you can either a) walk across the main road to JBMFP and Turtle Rock, or b) drive across the road to the Real Hidden Valley parking lot and hit both these problems. (30 second drive)

For Cap Rock, you'll need to drive.  Head south along the main road.  You'll pass Turtle Rock on your right, then Planet X on your left.  As the road starts to make a big left turn, the parking lot for Cap Rock will be to your right.  If you hit Ryan Campground, you've gone too far.

Buy the guidebook -- all of this is dead easy to figure out with the guide.  You'll also learn about a lot of cool problems that aren't necessarily the &quot;classics&quot; like Stem Gem.

Cheers.

Then you get climbers who should be in the advanced group but join the intermediate group (for example) and try to get the max points without being considered advanced just to win prizes.  Lame.  

The alternative is not having divisions until after people turn in their scorecards which generally works pretty well except that the judges can literally choose the winner of each division except for the highest.  

Not sure exactly what you mean by &quot;average out the scores and then divide&quot; but seems like the most logical thing to do would be to not have division sign ups and just rank everybody's scores, then divide the number of total competitors by the number of divisions and that's how many people are in each division.  
i.e.  100 competitors 4 divisions = 25 competitors in each division, ranks 1-25 in first division, etc.
Still though, you run into people coming in 15th place by having one more point than the 1st place of the preceding division...could get ugly.

Maybe a better format would be to calculate an all encompassing statistical score based on age, weight, ape index, years climbing, and your astrology sign and multiply that number by your score...or should you divide...damnit!

Just because it's kind of safe with 5 pads therefore makes it *not* an R rating?  There's a tough finishing move at the top.  I think the R is valid and provides the climber with a bit of a warning.  Now, if this thing was v5 at the bottom and 5.8 20-ft up, I'd understand...

If there are specific problems set for each category, and if they are given appropriate point values, it's highly unlikely that a person in a lower division would ever be able to rack up enough points to be competitive in an upper division.

Of course, these little details are what make the behind the scenes action at comps far more involved than most competitors realize.

Only counted your top 5.  Having said that, there's no way the guy who made first place in the intermediates stayed in the v3-v5 range.  (even 5 x 5,900 point problems only equals 29,500 -- his score was 32,460)

Better than nothing.

he call it a solo.  he has been working on it for a few years.  he stated his recent trip to the gtitstone really made it possible.  he stated he is not a soloist and it is more of a route.

the opening moves are V11 with a short V9 ish section in the middle followed by 5.12+ climbing that &quot; flows really well&quot; to the top.

he worked it on toprope extensivelly and had it wired.

honestly the climbing was not hard for him.  the length and new level of commitment was.

dales line ' transporter room ' to the left was also well rehearsed and he had it dialed.  the top of his problem / route is sketchy slab climbing.  

both are great climbers pushing standards in my opinion.  i know dale well and have spoken to kevin several times now.  he is a very positive and real person who has given me great energy and support.

on either line a fall from high even with LOTS of pads would result in serious injury.  the possibility of missing the pads all together is very real.

a agree insane is completly WRONG.  it was well within his ability and i believe he stepped off the ground believing it was the right time and place.

good job to kevin and also george who came close to sending the line last year.  i  watched him climb the upper section quite easily.  he is a soloist and grit climber.  it was the opening moves that stopped him.

It's odd because I could see Evilution as more of a &quot;problem&quot; then Jorgeson's new line, since the climbing backs off a lot after the lip and the meat of the climb is well within a reasonable height of being able to jump off, and Jorgeson's line seems pretty much full commitment from the get go.

I'm not trying to nay say. I just get tired of what is fed to us, I feel a lot of times people hold the importance of the send, fa, or solo even tighter than the climber that did it.

How about adding one level to the heirarchy of the DB? First Level could have three options: Socal, Norcal, National.  Since the entire db is user driven it'll be up to the users to populate the new sections, just as we've been doing.  We'll leave Fraction to do any cleaning up (ex. moving Bishop entries under Norcal).  From there users could have the option to add whatever they want depending on where they went/sent.  Maybe even add International for those who've gone to, say, Font, Hampi, New Zealand, etc.

There's nothing wrong with expanding, just gotta do so in an organized manner so that it makes sense.  <!-- shedbang --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/devil[2].gif\" alt=\"hedbang\" title=\"thrash1\" /><!-- shedbang -->

 I got to the last holds on the rail, left foot on the lower rail, toe, and was moving the right foot up before I blew my wad.  I'm thinking it's a right drop knee next.

Someone having that much mental and physical strength is extremely impressive regardless of whether the problem is a highball, solo, or whatever you want to call it.

By this criteria, most of Gill's classic problems in Colorado, Wyoming, etc., aren't boulder problems.

I didn't boulder that much in the milks bitd, but this was the line I always thought was the most impressive-- more than Mandala.  Folks have been eying 'Ambrosia&quot; for at least thirty years.   

And the bouldering/soloing distinction has become nearly hopeless.  At some point, we're going to start adding pad count to the evaluation of FAs.

The other Planet Granite in Belmont, Mission Cliffs, and Ironworks all have relatively small areas -- usually with route climbers directly behind you.  Kind of annoying.

When the park was covered in snow this problem felt like it had collected all the heat from everything around it and all we could do to bear it was continually shed layers to cope with the intensity of the heat, until we were down to the minimums of decency(at least for me). It was odd to have forties in the shade and then stand next to this scoop of rock that felt like ninety degrees. Even with the 
heat it was an awesome day, we did the mentioned problem which &quot;The Brit&quot; called classic grit.

Then sensei lived up to his handle and sent the arete/face directly to the left of Act of Contrition, which was quickly and aptly named &quot;Road to Perdition&quot;. When JDub got on it and finished the 18ft.ish crux with bad landing and man eating chasm we both realized that we had just experienced our scariest spot/climb ever. 

Its bizarre that in an area as vast as Joshua Tree there are problems good and bad that collect as much chalk as they do, then gems like &quot;Act of Contrition&quot;, which is literally a ten second walk from the car, can go seemingly untouched for seasons. I don't know, the nature of that problem is very conducive to concealing or dissuading use, tall, pale rock, fine grain, no distinct holds to hold or  collect chalk. Maybe I'm wrong, has anyone climbed this? If not grab some shoes you trust, confess your shortcomings and help turn this three star problem into a four star problem.";"a0fd7382e0ac15954dec7e590a6e8678";"0";;"a5gp8t1a";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

IMO it felt too smooth and the landing w.r.t. the lieback is a big psych-out factor with a number of small boulders in your fall zone.

All that said, it's on my project list.

I've only used it as a pad by itself, but it would be great for climbing by yourself to bring along with your regular pad to cover any sketchiness at the beginning.

I think it's best to concentrate compiled information on California-only bouldering mainly because we all live in CA.  Does anyone disagree with that? 

I wouldn't be so thrilled about having information on Oregon or Washington as I don't frequent these areas. If I wanted that kinda info I would Google for a website specific to the area. Also, if someone just happens to move out of state then tough luck; they should join other forums/online communities and contribute to databases relevant to their new state and pebble piles (but definitly keep-in-touch!)

Think about this scenario; someone from Utah logs into this site and sees db entries for Arizona? Or Vegas? That's just silly given what the name of the site indicates.  That's like visiting the Toyota website and seeing information on Honda Civics.  <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->

Also tightening up the length of each navigation segment so that there's not as much black space between each one.

Zing!  <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->

But seriously, the line of &quot;west coast&quot; is broad, no?  Technically, is Joshua Tree west coast?  Where does &quot;the west coast&quot; end?  A certain state line?  A specific latitude? 

And frankly, who cares?  Let's expand the site a little bit ... see who joins us.  What are we afraid of?

Of course that goes for Washington and Oregon too but ... we won't rehash ... But yeah west coast implies west coast states.

In terms of businesss, is the intention to compete for advertising and traffic with rockclimbing or mountainproject?  If so then by all means go for it!  Should probably add a tier for State (eventually we'll do countries).  

But then what are you going to change the website title to, USBouldering?  This db could get as chossy and unreliable as rockclimbing and mountainproject.  <!-- s:confused: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/headscratch[1].gif\" alt=\":confused:\" title=\"confused\" /><!-- s:confused: -->

Would the remaining gyms get loads of new members? Would our crags become more crowded? Or would less and less people climb because of the constant need to travel to experience the real thing, or more importantly maybe would fewer people would climb because of the fact that they can't simulate the real thing after work?

 What if more gyms started closing and the competition circuit was threatened? Would that effect the ability of a company to sponsor their rockstars because of a lack of advertisement? Without the inspiration or general radness of these rockstars in the mags or videos would people have the will to climb while having to create their own methods and motivations?

  So now all gyms are closed and we live in a fallen empire, we once thought that California was rock Mecca, and it is with a car, but few people climb and with no one to share the toll of gas, we can't afford it. The shoe companies are gone and the remaining climbers cobble their own shoes.

 twenty years go by and China has got so big that we make stuff for them. Nokia comes here and makes us live in dorms and pays us in room and board. People remember what climbing is but no one does it. Until it becomes a mystery for a new civilization to unravel. Our own kind of  glyph.

Took Friday off and drove out to Bishop.  Met some great people and managed to get a lot of good looking video of some hard climbs.

I showed up Friday and met up with Brian Hedrick and Mark Heal.  Mark worked on “Stained Glass” (v10) for awhile before the rock tore up his fingertips.  Nearby, Giovanni “G” Traversi made an incredible send of “Haroun and the Sea of Stories” (v12).  Got that one on video.  Daniel Woods, Ethan Pringle and Doug Munsch showed up just before the send.  Afterwards, the whole group was led by Charlie Barrett across the valley to “Xavier’s Roof” (v12).

The whole group took shots at it, but the sends went to Daniel and Brian.  After that, we cruised down to “Zen Flutes” — a v10 face with a long dyno finish.  I worked on a v7 around the corner.  (when I find my guidebook, I’ll have a name for the thing, but since I didn’t complete it, no rush.)

The crew finished the day on “Solitaire” (v8).  The problem starts on a low sloping rail on a angled wall, followed by a long move to another sloping rail, then a full dyno to a sharp edge over the top.  Once again, the send train rolled in and everyone who tried it, made it up.

Brian and Mark went off to Vons for camp food while G, myself, Daniel, Ethan, and Doug grabbed burgers at Whiskey Creek.  G got his own hotel room (lame) and the other 4 of us split a room at a local motel.

[b:335pcy0w]Saturday[/b:335pcy0w]

Woke up long before everyone else, and laid in bed rifling through work emails and catching up on Twitter and my RSS feeds.  We got out to the Milks around 10am, met up with Emanuel Moosburger and his pal David from Austria.  The 8-man crew tromped out to Secrets of the Beehive — a ~30ft tall v7 with a crux finish.  Ethan made the first send and made it look easy.  Mark came up second, followed by Brian, then Daniel.  I took a few go’s at it, but couldn’t make it past a v5/v6 move at the bottom. Doug made it up “Queen Sweet Nectar” (v9) from the 2nd move on — he swears he’ll get it from the start next time.

It's before Riverside city but yeah I think Elsinore is in Riverside County (?). About 30+ minutes after you pass Anaheim Hills on the 91 east.  It's a fucking junk yard when you first enter the area via dirt road (make sure your car has some off-roading capability). But once you're in the back hills where the bouldering is, it's pretty recluse.  Some approaches are obvious, others have mildly established trails. The dirt roads can actually lead you up to the very top of the main area as they wind around/through.  The sick thing is that the majority of established rock is in the first two hills; there's an entire gawdamn valley of boulders behind them.  Louie I believe is working on updating the current topo/info.  He said he and Matt Hulet were in the process of putting together a guide (hopefully this year?).

Fuck yeah bro~  The order I'm planning on is 
1) Slashface 
2) The Function 
3) Up 40
4) So High

I'd love to get the first three done before the end of the year. Possibly get to #4 depending on how much I get done but it's more likely to be next year.

Goals:
1. Break V6 (I'm setting the bar low  <!-- sjoe1 --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/biggrinjester[1].gif\" alt=\"joe1\" title=\"wiseguy\" /><!-- sjoe1 -->)
2. Break V7 if #1 goes down

Right on.
Slashface is so good you want it to be ten feet taller.
How could I forget putting the Function on my list, I got on it on a sweltering day and sweat myself off, I don't think its as bad as it looks.
Have you got on Up40? Besides it being the mental crux of your list I think it probably has the easiest climbing to it. The movement is awesome on super solid holds. We played high point on it for a bit and for as solid as we felt on it no one wanted to commit to getting on the upper section. Needless to say that day I was exercising my down climbing and aiming skills.
I don't know why but SoHigh has never really caught my eye, but from what I've learned on it is that the start is hard, middle is fun, end is committing.";"05300bad7ec7b9ac3bd4ae250548484c";"0";"gA==";"35qopd4s";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

In the upper section spotters are going to be of very little use and will probably and hopefully be the last thing on your mind, so if you feel serious about doing it one day just tell then to not worry about the spot, just move the pads. I think once you get on it and you feel the seriousness of it you'll probably stop thinking of it as a boulder problem and more of a solo anyways. I've only climbed on it a couple times but it has more of a solo/adventurous feel to it than a lot of other tall problems I've done. Or you could just tell them you are only going to climb the bottom half and then just go for the top!

Either way looks like you're down to have some fun/scares this year. Good luck and tread lightly.";"39c3a84420219ab0c0a84badfa7bdd36";"0";"gA==";"f6btab5n";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

I have been climbing down there for 20 years so I should know.  The bottom line is when conditions are optimal it might be one of the best &quot;little&quot; crags I've climbed at.  That being said when conditions are anything other than optimal it might be one of the worst.  Look for Santa Ana or other windy conditions and/or low humidity.  If the cave is not dry it's not worth the trip.  The sandy highball topouts add a sense of adventure to the place.  Read John Long's latest article in R&amp;I.  I don't know about it getting old fast as there are always eliminates and variations to be done.  That being said I wouldn't make a long drive to get there (I live 10 min. away).  The place is best suited to the V3 - V6 climber.  Lot's of classics in this range! Heretic I saw your post in the database, and Anabelle is in a state of flux.  Many holds have broken and will continue to break!  As of two weeks ago that cave was dripping with water runoff rendering Anabelle unclimable.  Be sure to check the tide level and remember to bring a towel, crashpad, or piece of carpet to wipe your feet on.  The rock is becomming really polished from doods climbing with sandy feet.  Sometimes dirty, sometimes wet, sometimes packed with tourons, the Beach may be the most fickle climbing spot on earth.

Now does 4.8 round to 5.0 for a V5- or is it V4+? Intuitively with 2 votes for V5, V5- sounds right.  

So let's look at Not So Thin Lizzy.  Currently it's at 3- but under the new algorithm it comes to 2.5 (disclaimer: math done in my head off memory, might wanna double check).  So given 2.5, how does the system evaluate it?

- V2 since 2.5 is equidistant from 2.0 and 3.0, making it a moderate V2
- V2+ since it's greater than 2.0 but less than 3.0 (not sure where the cutoff is for the system's interpretation of V2 or V2-)
- V3- (what it currently is now) if we follow mathematical rounding

I assume also if we get something like 10 sends at V10, it will still evalutate to V10, not V10-?";"3d5bfaaf0797979e697712caac6dfbf3";"0";;"3ilegp41";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

Yes - your vote will still count, even if it's ridiculous.  If something gets reported though, I may take a look and remove it (v1 on The Swarm, for instance).

Now you're gonna force my hand and tell you the surprise.  No rounding.  No v4+, v5- (what's the difference).  Consensus grades will be shown in decimal format.  This was Sensei's original idea, and I've come to like it -- a lot.

In my test database (snapshot taken in December), here's what I have for Thin Lizzy:

Nov 15, 2008	Heretic	v2	
Nov 9, 2008	thatonekid	v3	
Dec 2, 2007	fraction	v2	
Nov 1, 2007	Daytripper	v2	
Jul 4, 2002	rtm	v2	

  	Consensus: 	v2.06


That's a weighted average...  (normal average would be: 2.2).

Let's change my tick grade to a v10:

Feb 26, 2009	fraction	v10	
Nov 15, 2008	Heretic	v2	
Nov 9, 2008	thatonekid	v3	
Nov 1, 2007	Daytripper	v2	
Jul 4, 2002	rtm	v2	
  	Consensus: 	v2.82 	

v2.82  ( normal average would be: v3.8 )  ... so the weighting reduces the affects of outliers without totally throwing them out.";"30ca414b347296386f4629d328bf8d27";"0";"gA==";"3lwh6jn3";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

We had a good chat when i first started working on the ProblemDB ... he was sick of teh +'s and -'s and &quot;hards&quot; and &quot;softs&quot; etc ... he really wanted decimals.  at first, it was weird to me, but the more i see it on my test site, the more i like it.  

we also had a nice long chat about grades based on people's physical attributes.  being able to see what a problem is graded based on people's weight, height, APE index, etc.  (if you know Rob, you know how analytical he can get on this stuff).  

so no longer would a description read &quot;hard if you're short&quot;  -- you'd actually see what people at your height graded the problem.  kinda cool";"6a5aeb3ba1cf19636616962638d715a5";"0";"EA==";"22tl10rq";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

In my early years it was a training ground for going out and doing routes since there were no climbing gyms. If I reflect back on the place it's not so much the climbs as it is the many people I met down there . I met many of my early climbing partners there and remember the social scene there as much as anything else. That being said there are some damn good problems there and when the conditions are right I still try and find a way to get there. I've been down there a couple times recently and saw lots of young climbers psyched on the place and lots of problems heavily chalked which was really cool. There are plenty of negatives about the place if that's what you choose to focus on and I'm sure a lot gym bred climbers will write the place off as choss. I just wish someone would clean the City Ordinance Crack so I can do it again, that was always one my favorites. Maybe I'll have to clean it myself.";"5214ccfb8524dd2098f5da2bed8be8c1";"0";;"3cisrx0u";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

bleeder/deeloinn - The rock was definitely a welcome change from JTree sandpaper and slippery-ass Tram stone.

Woody was a long time climber at Hangar 18 Riverside, i recall when he came in around 1998 wearing a bandana and full of energy. Woody climbed on the rocks of socal before John Long and was an early developer.

(pics are not me)  


So I've seen a couple people refer to the steve mcqueen boulder thats here in town?  I'm not sure where this would be by name but im pretty familiar with the area (lived here most of my life)....where exactly is it at?  



Also, a friend and i found (i think?  there was no sign of development on it) an overhanging arete and an inclined circular traverse on one of the first hills once you enter into steel valley from nichols rd.  You'll know it by the boring highball rock jutting up on the left side of the top and a boulder pile.  Theres pacman graffiti on the front.  Drive past it and turn on the spur trail to the backside, then up the hill, you'll see a giant snowman spraypainted on the back of a big egg. right in front of that is a scaly boulder with a REALLY fun sds overhanging arete with good moves.  ...we figured it to be V2- maybe less...big holds, really fun.  Theres definately holds to build some v4-5 problems off the undercling starting holds down in the cave, and some short face/crack problems with creative sit starts...definately worth checking out.  Dont know if its FA but like i said, there was no sign of any development, and its too good of a climb to not see regular chalk.  We called it the Insecurity boulder and the problem &quot;Dont Judge Me&quot;.  If someone has already done it, let me know.  

Next to it is an inclined flat lipped boulder with a ton of fun variations and traverse/rail problems. You can do a circular traverse around the whole thing, although the landing is rocky at the upper part of the route  Its got a bunch of crappy graffiti on it and theres been some walls made under it to enclose the cave off...  I'll put some pics up soon.

We used to climb some of the rocks in the valley between the summits and the weird satellite dishes, has anyone done a topo for that area?  Louie?


Also, curious if anyone on here has climbed the solitary metamorphic boulder on the spur trail that heads towards fishermans camp off of the tenaja falls trail?  We've been climbing it for a while, know we werent the first, but cleaned a few new routes on it.  Just curious what people were rating some of the runs... most of the stuff we found on it was v0-v2 with maybe a harder route or two on the overhang...


Anyone ever hit up the bluebird boulders by the campground off of ortega?  


and as far as tenaja is concerned, we've been going up to la cresta heights a bit lately and running some fun boulders on the graded lots (should stay empty for a while now considering the economy)... some fun problems....sooooo many boulders taken away by mini-mansions already though.  However, half the hill is national park property, and there are alot of undeveloped rocks surrounded by dense chapperal. Working on responsible singletrack trailbuilding up there, if anyone is interested, let me know. theres some highball slab routes protected by a single hanger on a rock above the water tower, and from there are some other problems... nothing crazy...but cool to check out if youre bored and in the area.  Anyone else work any problems up here?


The overhanging hemet boulder off gibbel with the sit starts, anyone have appropriate ratings on that?  (side note, simpson park is FUN! not alot of hard climbs, but some surprising variety- really good energy up there with jack mcbroom and the hemet underground climbers...super positive guys) The rock off of Gibbel-

Anyone climb the rocks off of leon rd in menifee (not the rocks off of newport with the painted eagle and the two highballs)?  easiest way is to turn onto leon from domenigoni and head south on the oiled dirt road, park near the 90 degree bend in the road, FUN traverses on the flat side of the road, and a few fun problems on the hillside, with room for more. not sure if this side of the hill is private, but we've never gotten hassled.

The boulderfield in lamb's canyon, referred to in craig fry's guide as the glue-on boulder area... the south side of the highway...not the best, but some fun climbs none the less...anyone ever hike around there?

Graham, the rest I've never heard of but hey I'm glad SOMEONE is exploring Steele Valley! Anderson (socalbolter) would be your best bet to confirm anything there.  Louie previously mentioned to me that any exploration, discovery and establishment is fine for anyone but he would like it to pass his way for confirmation before documenting it in this DB (he and Matt Hulet are putting together an *official* guide).  Chances are it hasn't been established if you haven't seen any chalk or rubber stains on it.

1. an absolutely poor description.  I'm talking epic FAIL. Literally know one knows what the fuck you're talking about, what the holds are like. etc.
2. little to no approach directions.  This only applies when the parent level(s) do not adequately describe the approach
3. If #1 and/or #2 apply, no pics or video
4. the shit is just wrong.  ex: someone makes an entry with pics of a problem that is obviously, say, Dark Matter, but calls it &quot;Purple People Eater&quot; and rates it V19.

If there's no opposition to this, could we start some process for which we all can review a particular entry for it's level of quality?  Some have already done this at some level, ex: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.westcoastbouldering.com/problemdb/section.php?id=1153\">http://www.westcoastbouldering.com/prob ... hp?id=1153</a><!-- m -->.  This entry, according to those who chimed in, qualifies for #1, doesn't for #2 as the parent level (Pile Ups) has pretty good directions, and qualifies for #3.

Now at this point, it would be cool if the entry could be marked as &quot;up for review&quot; by the community and if there are no issues after some time period X, the entry stays and we live happily ever after.  However if the community opposes it for whatever reason, the account that entered it is sent a PM indicating that the entry requires some editing or clarification (as specified by the community via comments).  If said edits/clarifications are not made within some time period Y, the entry is deleted and the account is again notified of the deletion. If edits are made, time period X is restarted and allowed to expire if all is good.

Nope. The majority of the work was to move over all the current functionality over to a new PHP architecture and change the UI a bit.  I've made a few minor feature changes here and there, but it should behave 95% similarly to the current application.

- UI change
- DB schema change (mostly minor)
- switched from homegrown PHP to MVC architecture -- should result in faster response and easier for me to update/bugfix

the mcqueen boulder is actually near Fallbrook, i dont know the streetnames, but its off a  curvey, 2 lane hi way with a pretty viewpoint, and its up on a hillside. you look across at a winery or a golf course or a really nice house.

i have lived near March AFB most of my climbing life, and have spent a good deal of time climbing on the vast expanse of granitic eggs we have between Riverside proper and San Diego. 
most of my exploring has turned up either blank granite eggs, with sort of oldskool slab crimp jazz. when that type of rock has overhangs, the plates usually exfoliate pretty quickly. 

Steele Valley is a good example, only 1 out of every 20 boulders will have a decent problem on it, let a lone a modern, overhanging or bouldery type problem.

Nuevo, Hemet, etc are all relatively worthless if you have time to drive to a more worthwhile destination, such as Black, Jtree, the Jupiters, or even Horseflats.

I can shoot up to hemet in the morning and do a 10 problem circuit before noon and be back to pick up my daughter.  Second, I enjoy hiking to new areas that i have no beta on and figuring stuff out.   Dont get me wrong, if i get the chance, i'll run up to tram, or Black Mountain, Santee or Bishop... but the convenience of the valley boulderfields keep me on the rock on a frequent basis and thats all i care about...

That being said, I was under the impression that the steve mcqueen boulder was that one on rainbow valley rd by the border check...that highball on the side of the road.  Its not near rock mountain is it?

I agree with you on the blank egg issue...its very frustrating to see such a huge amount of rocks only to have most of them be unclimbable...  Going up the ridge on the south side of the freeway at the border check (the opposite side of where the rainbow boulders are), most of the rocks are just BLANK.  

I actually enjoy face climbing alot more than i do overhanging, so being around here isnt such a burden as well.

Ian McIntosh and I are working with Wolverine on a guide to that beautiful mountain. This guide will be rad. Wolverine publishes the best guides in the country, including Bishop and Hueco bouldering. This is what we are shooting for - a guide for Black Mountain that can compare with the cream of the crop. 

We see this as a community project, since the climbing at Black Mountain is endless and predates just about everyone currently going up there. We've been busy exploring new areas and scrubbing new boulders, and to keep on schedule we're shooting for twenty new problems a week. This is hard! We know where the projects are, we just need help climbing them. We've got this thing, I think it's a blog, where we are going to put up info on new problems and new areas. Take a look: blackmountainbouldering.blogspot.com. It's new, but there should be updates bi-weekly.

We've completed topos and descriptions for all of the well-known problems (around 450 of them), so let us know if you know of any areas up there, or do any cool projects, or have any great photos, or know the history. We'll repay by letting you all know what we discover.

The process continues. We'll both be at Black Mountain on the weekends and most Wednesdays. We're working on a new area near the bottom of the mountain right now, called The Republic. We'll be out there Wednesday, so email <!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:blackmountainblog@gmail.com\">blackmountainblog@gmail.com</a><!-- e --> if you'd like directions.

When we wasted time slicing and dicing the numbers, I know that Neal Kaptain and I were using basically the same breakdown that Curt Shannon did for Verm's book, with B2 starting at V6.    That was based on Gill's use of the Bs, though, and in Cali and AZ, the letters were vastly different.  

Translation from B to V doesn't matter much, in any case.  But my guess is that thin cranks now get graded stiffer, and mantles softer, than would've been the case before climbing gyms.  I would've called Facemeat harder than Boneheads, for instance.   Very minor point.

Does skipping holds on an existing problem equate to a new problem or is it just a variation of the existing problem?

Let's look at it from different perspectives. What's a good example of a problem with variations?...Caveman in JTree. It ends on two different places outside the cave, you can skip the hidden hueco to bump the grade up by one, you can take a high juggy variation or stay low on a sweet gaston, and you can even do it in reverse.  But they are all still considered Caveman.

So when is a new problem generally established off an existing problem?:
a) adding a new, ridiculously difficult SDS (ex: the Chuckawalla Sit)
b) adding a new, ridiculously difficult topout/end (ex: EZ Direct Mantle)
c) combination of a. and b. (ex: Mandala Direct SDS)
d) joining two or more problems (ex: Terremer, The Wheel of Life)
e) same start, same finish, different path (ex. I-FLOP vs Pancake House, Double Orifice vs Double Orifice Direct)

So when is it not a new problem? 
- Given an existing problem following an order A-B-C, when starting at A, ending at C, following an intended path B, you skip holds or use intermediates. With respect to skipping holds or using intermediates, neither warrant a proclamation of a new or distinct problem as all available holds pre-exist on path B, and how they are utilized may be easier, harder or equal in difficulty depending on your stats and/or climbing style. Consequently, this should only warrant a tick with a reasonable grade, given the climbers stats and style, and what/how existing holds on path B were used during the send.
- A simpler argument; we all tend to skip holds on VB's and V0's, especially in the gym. But do we ever claim it's a new problem?  Usually never. We just call it a &quot;variation&quot; of an existing problem, if anything.

Some problems where skipping holds are regarded as distinct problems:
- The Crack Eliminate at Stoney. Skipping all the holds on the right side but nonetheless just a harder variation of an already great problem?
- Vaino's Dyno at Stoney.  Skips everthing between the start holds and the sloper topout of the Yabo Mantle.  Some of you really tall guys don't even need to dyno, it's just a really huge dynamic move.  Some really high feet and even a shorter guy like me can reach the sloper from the same start holds.
- Unitizing the &quot;G&quot; at the Tram - Offroutes a large foothold, otherwise the same as Nipple Shredder.  Who removed the pink-on-blue tape from the foothold? <!-- sjoe1 --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/biggrinjester[1].gif\" alt=\"joe1\" title=\"wiseguy\" /><!-- sjoe1 -->

There is a slight gray area; a certain run-and-jump...A Streetcar Named Desire. Given the nature of this run-and-jump, the &quot;start hold&quot; is the topout dish.  But different start hold == distinct problem! However, some consider this to be just a different variation of Streetcar...<!-- s:confused: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/headscratch[1].gif\" alt=\":confused:\" title=\"confused\" /><!-- s:confused: -->";"abe1b1bad6905bd8cb85488a1bf0d186";"0";;"1in2gvnl";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

I've been climbing there for a couple years and ive been able to reconcile some areas with recognizable boulders and the topo, but some of the other areas listed in the database on here im not familiar with.  Amoeba area? etc.

The reason im asking is that i took advantage of the cold weather this week and put up some more problems on a couple boulders ive been going to on a hill near the entrance that ive been calling the therapy area.  See the pics for clarification.  Everything appeared unclimbed.  Had alot of fun running around there with my daughter, but she was also my photographer so i didnt get as many pics as id like... (lots of zoomed in shots of my head).

The ratings are just off the top of my head, i cant say im that good at rating, i want some other people to go up there and do the climbs to get a consensus, so i made a couple wolverine style topos.

feedback on the area is welcomed...

There are many more problems already established there than shown on your topos.

Whenever free time allows, I would like to do a more complete topo/guide to the area, but time never seems to make itself available.

The Amoeba Boulder is uphill from the Shotgun Boulder and that grouping, above and right of the problem Elevation.  There is a somewhat highball problem on the front side that climbs up to and past an orange amoeba shaped feature.  Most of the problems are in a narrow corridor on the backside of the boulder and are shorter than Amoeba.

Any idea how far off my ratings on some of those were then?  and also if the lines ran the same?  I saw that there was a vhard problem on the snowman boulder but that is way past my skill level.  I wasnt trying to topo something i wont even contemplate climbing.

not so much. 

What gets me is when a hold breaks and the person that re-establishes it claims an &quot;FA&quot;, sometimes even renaming the problem!

I put up a problem at JTree which I did a huge move in the middle, then people were repeating it using a sidepull crimp. Eventually the crimp broke, then someone was claiming a re-&quot;FA&quot;, and even upstroking the grade. I never even used the sidepull in question on the real FA.

as dimit would say - Fu$#%ng idiots, all of them!!

Homepage is completely new -- rotating photos at the top, news section consolidated, Case Studies at the bottom and archived.  The ProblemDB has been recreated from the ground up -- you shouldn't really notice a whole lot of difference, except for some speed improvements (hopefully).  The biggest change might be the new grading system -- decimals.  Lots of reasons for this.  Also, I've added &quot;birthday&quot; to your profile details in the problemdb -- when you get a chance, fill this out (we don't display your day, just your age).  We'll use this data to create more &quot;top users&quot; sections where we separate users by gender and age.  I have a few new features I want to add to the ProblemDB (R/X ratings, and Flash/Redpoint/etc), but needed to rebuild the guts first. Nothing new in the forum, but a little work on the theme to match the rest of the site.

Russ &quot;The Fish&quot; Walling, took advantage of the flat desert floor, not just as a landing but as a runway too.

Later the route was stemmed in more conventional style.(B+).&quot;

Grades and stars are now weighted.  Here's how it works:

1st grade (when the problem is added).  (example: v1)
1st tick --&gt; normal average of 1st grade plus 1st tick (ex: v1 + v2 / 2 = v1.5)

This thread also reminded me that I need to do some work today in the ProblemDB.  There used to be a feature that I haven't gotten around to rebuilding yet -- finding problems, by grade, in a particular area.  Currently, you can sort pretty well, but you can't limit by area.  I'll take a pass at it this afternoon -- hopefully have something up for you by tonight.  This will allow you to see the best problems for you at the Tram -- then purchase the guide for more details and directions.

I've only tried this problem once.  I would match on the incut left-facing flake thing and move with my left hand into the two finger pocket, then I would go up right handed to the grey intrusion crimp...From here I could see how a heel-hook would work but I couldn't do it at the time. 

I also tried matching on the incut left-facing flake and crossing right handed to the desperate sloper down and right from the grey intrusion crimp, then I had to throw a left foot karate kick onto the wall in a stem like position.  This might've worked too but maybe this is the V7/V9 difference in beta.

The attitude expressed here is so typical of the young boulderer todaym and frankly it sucks.  Here's an illustration of my point: I went to Hueco with some peeps a short while back, one wanted to get on that cave probelm on the boulder adjacent to Baby Face Boulder...I forget the name, but if I recall the grade, it's V7 I think...starts as a sit at the back of the cave on crappy holds and then goes straight back, you can use a wicked knee bar or lunge staright backwards...sorry I forget the name but it's a benchmark problem.  So I watch this person try and learn the problem, and each time they start the problem over, they begin to start on holds that are further into the problem, in essence removing three to four moves of the climb.  I don't know the person well enough to call dab at this point.  Anyway, they finally give it a push...but like four moves into the prob and send.  They get all exicted and stoked, high fives etc...and I all can say to my buddy with whom I am standing with away from the hoopla is that was not a send, no way, no how.  This exact event happended later on the trip on a Standard V8 for Hueco, this time I called dab as they decided that the original 15-feet of the problem were not important enough to include and the probelm was the same regardless. The remark was something like, &quot;on the videos I have seen of the problem, professionals today don't start there.&quot;  Great, forget the history of the rig, dumb it down because a new generation deems it not worthy...nice for our sport.

Same thing with Chili Sauce...if one is going to claim a send, one ought to be ethical about the matter and send the problem, not some other contrived version of it just to boost one's ego.";"b784ec9316774464364733bb342b0404";"0";;"3vtk6ko8";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

I am not a young boulderer as I have been climbing for 20+ years.  Whetether you use a heel hook or not the handholds are the same.  Just because Jerry didn't use a heel hook doesn't mean we all have to climb it the same way.  Do you really think Jerry didn't use it on pupose?  I think it is more than likely he just didn't see it that way. I had done the problem the original way when I learned of the sneaky new heel hook beta.  I think Rob Mulligan was the first to use it?  Anyway my point is that as long as you use all the original holds you have done the problem. If Jerry had used a heel hook on the FA would doing the problem without one also be offensive to you?  I totally agree that history is lost on many of today's younger climbers.  Most of them couldn't even tell you who John Gil is, but everyone who climbs should be able to apply their own ethics to their climbing as long as they are not damaging the rock.

I have never used the heel hook so I take your word that the hand holds are the same, given this, a heel hook obviously takes a lot of weight off your crimps...and changes the way one progresses upward from that point.  No wonder it's not V9.  To your point about the original holds, the rock where the heel would go is not original...that's not an original foot hold...which is my point.

When I hopped on this classic, a heel hook never entered my mind as a solution, the natural line and feel (for me and I guess Jerry) was to go right up the middle using the face.  To answer your question, if the original probelm did entaill a heel hook and someone later decied to do it not using one, no, I would not at all be offended.  Eliminates have a place in bouldering, making stuff harder is fun...part and parcel of bouldering.  

Ethics in bouldering to me are important because alot of the time it's just you and the rock with no witnesses around...why do you think calling DAB became such an important part of bouldering recently...I think it's a really cool thing that some of today's boulderers invented...keeps em honest.

the brits are known for their pulling skills. such fu is their style but just that. using a heel hook is a different way to do it. the problem is that the line is contrived because it, the original way, climbs too close to an obvious heelhook. I really don't understand your attitude and your emphasis on ethics. Besides, what is ethical about bouldering style? I've yet to see the ethos behind anything in bouldering except the spotter doing what he/she says. (Ethics is morality-based and relates to the responsibility one has to others: like for pilots, etc). 

anywho, wanting beta on a contrived problem is cool, but your attitude is BULLSHIT&gt; doing the problem WITHOUT heel hooking IS contrived cause it's a forced style just to get a higher score. 

a rating can be defined as being the most efficient way to climb it under the best conditions. V6 is what I think it is--based on problems in hueco, but maybe 7 too. if this is applied to chili sauce then the heel hook is the logical way to send it, choosing harder ways is up to you but not required of others. 

but serious, chili sauce is nice, but there are better lines in that rating worth doing... Y2K or Right2K are both in the 8 or 9 category and way more clean and pure. There's also Bittersweet (9), electro gecko 2000 (7ish- pure pulling power and NO WAY to heel hook, but it's a choss pile  <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s:wink: --> ), dark amber (7), broken flowers (7 or 9/ stand or sit), the north wind (7ish--ultra pure), kingpin (6?), line right of kingpin, and several new lines around the peanut ranging from 4 to 7ish (they are on a boulder called the Bushmill, due east of the Peanut with the backside, facing east, having two lines, one on the left and one in the center, then around front is an arete that starts off a block with a way hard first move after you hang the start pinch), also just above the peanut is a slasher face of slopers that goes up the right side clearly visible from the peanut--up and left about 100 feet, etc, etc, etc, etc. I think all these are in the shade at one time or another. some are not in the guidebook cause they are super new.

1) the problem is that the line is contrived because it, the original way, climbs too close to an obvious heelhook. 

2) I really don't understand your attitude and your emphasis on ethics. Besides, what is ethical about bouldering style?

There is a problem in colorado known as Meathook. V11. It didn't get a second ascent for years until this guy, a local, and not young either, sent it using a drop knee. some said it was not a legit ascent. The fact is the guy couldn't do it the original way because he's not tall enough. the move goes into an undercling, if memory serves me, and if you are too short it's damn near impossible to do. the truth is, the line being pure, his use of a dropknee IS because he's damn good at that technique (a veritable expert at it since watching him hike anything in the black hole at morrison--powerpulling just doesn't work in the blackhole). His ascent was different, but it wasn't &quot;unethical,&quot; it was just a different style of movement applied. 

I realize some peeps skip start holds, of which I think is totally lame. I've asked rTm to designate start holds and start beta for a new version of the jt guide of which I think he's fine doing. I also dislike peeps doing stussy-starts (bumping from the ground to get the next hold without actually pulling on first). The irony is today in high level comps is a stussy start will/can get you DQ'd. climbing style is of utmost importance and should be suppported and addressed whenever possible, and it should be done in a nice and educational way. some peeps simply don't know better and really just need to be edumacated. I also have an issue with the spotter touching the boulderer, or the boulderer hitting or scrapping the pad or a tree, etc. Their response is that they would have held it anyways. Of course if they were that omniscient, then why climb it at all since they already know what they WILL do.  <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s:wink: --> This type of practice is most often established in the gym, and peeps could politely tell others that that isn't actually climbing, it's climbing with an aid point. But most think it arrogant or elitist or presumptious. It is. And it's also important for the sport or practice that the community be the glue that holds and binds and promotes real quality style... we all know the mags are too pretentious and self-righteous to do that for us. (fuck the mags)

when a person shorts their sending style, they short their character. What I mean is that their low standard will also reflect on how they do things in life, and they will be the looser in the long run. This, of course, is not anyone's concern or business but the person in question. Luckily, I've seen very few incidents of this practice amongst the sponsored climbers, but some do it for sure. I've been body-checked on a dyno in hueco where the guy said it was fine, ie. he'll take it nevertheless--and he's sponsored, albeit at a low level). I didn't call him on it cause I felt it was my fault for giving a damn about his health (literally against my back was a 6 foot block and he would have landed on his back on the edge).

but the point is that free climbing is about using ONLY yourself to go from the designated bottom to the top or anchors (hmmm, um, sure). Any contact with anything not part of the climb is not free climbing--it's using aid, also known as an A0 point. But in that same breath, using anything on the wall that's within reach shouldn't be off. making something off, as you said is an eliminit (ie, moffet put up an eliminit with chili sause, as i see it)

so, plasticmullet, it does suck to watch it, but the truth is that person isn't taking anything away from you, me or others, just themselves. and I agree, mentioning something is difficult, but I think quite necessary sometimes. I think the best thing to do is mention it BEFORE the person &quot;sends.&quot; Of course, that's easier said then done.";"f68866a7e3cf897e719102f51f89c63f";"0";;"2yoqxvto";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

2) This is not surprising. Style is core to bouldering, even asking your question demonstrates you lack it and ethics.

You says it's a classic; therefore, I'm required to judge it as such. The fact of the matter is moffet put up a contrived climb without using all the tools at his disposal. The fact is the heel hook is NOT far off to the left, as you say. the line is climbed with the same two crimps reached after leaving the dihedral and one either heels to the left or pulls straight up. you sound like you don't even know the climb. 

By establishing it as a &quot;classic,&quot; your view is that one is NOT allowed to change it in any way. That's taleban thinking, my fellow human. Not my &quot;style.&quot; I choose to judge it on IT'S merits, not moffet's. To assume the GREAT moffett the final arbiter of style is your mistake. I think you hold this guy and the problem in too high esteem. That's too bad since it prevents you from seeing the obvious. Faith is your downfall and moffet is no saint. You should try climbing other problems, so you can see that this is just another boulder problem, and one that isn't all the great.

Thanks for supporting what I said. Style is core to bouldering, NOT ethics. You clearly don't get it. I didn't intend to ask a serious question about ethics. My point is that ethics and the discussion of it is a misnomer. The question should only be about style.

Original beta and original grade is a v7.  Recently, someone figured out v4 beta -- same exact holds, same start, same finish -- just different movement.  

So what do we do?  You could argue all of the following:

1)  the original FA didn't use the v4 beta, and therefore you can only claim you've done it if you used the original beta.  If we were to enforce this rule, we'd have to know exact beta for every problem everywhere.  in my opinion, that's a bit unrealistic.  

2) the original FA uses certain beta.  if you use the v4 beta, you're doing a different problem, therefore you can only claim you've done a Crouching Tiger *[i:2m3acfut]variation[/i:2m3acfut]*

3) the original FA made the problem WAY harder than it needed to be.  If I decide to use different beta (heel hook, drop knee, left hand instead of right), why shouldn't I be allowed to say I did the problem?  People use different beta for different climbs all the time based on height, APE, etc.  Why is this any different? (again, the argument here is for different beta -- the Hueco example of starting the problem in a completely different place is not at issue here)

If we took this Chili Sauce argument to the very end, we should also include what Jerry was wearing, the temp conditions, and what shoes he was wearing.

how can you say the heel hook is so far away? check out the picture of the guy on the problem at the two crimps (chili sauce 1 and 2 images): the left crimp is arrived at from the vertical incut in the dihedral--a long move out left. the right crimp, above and to the right, is arrived at from either standing on your right or dropping in the dihedral. From that point one can either heelhook or not. 

if one can reach the heel hook from the two crimps then how can it be a &quot;problem change?&quot;

I feel you are embellishing this idea of it being &quot;so far removed&quot; to justify your point. It's not... look at the picture. Please feel free to tell me your beta. 

I think the heel hooks, toe hooks, drop knees, and such are techniques many dont use. If one can pull on crimps and such, one will. Taking the time to set up more complex moves requires different skillsets, including more body tension, more composure, more balance, more flexibility, and the mindset to try it. Not choosing to learn and use a different technique, safely, is one person's mistake or choice, not someone else's problem. 

what constitutes a great line? Isn't it, among other attributes, a pure line without anything to distract it including variations and options? Alexandria is top notch, but it has a right exit that's harder. I think that makes alexandria the highest aesthetic line on the rosetta stone, and maybe nicer then the Rosetta Stone line on the far right, over the right exit of the river nile, but only by a small amount. But what about a line that's completely void of any other options? Take the new lines The North Wind (in real hidden valley proper) and Broken Flowers (100 feet north of the first parking slot in real hidden valley). Both have zero options where traversing or using anything and trying to go anywhere leaves you with something harder or potentially undoable. But chili sauce has the ledge system that is not only easily accessable, but can be heel hooked by simply reaching your heel up and left to the ledge. Hell, one can even traverse further left and exit the face entirely. My point is that this line is simply not that stellar, and it's plagued by reachable jugs. It's a frickin' eliminit!

Exactly.  You did do the problem, but who's to say just because you used the new beta that it was easier for you.  Those same characteristics you listed could cause the new beta to be harder.  This is why grades should be consensus and dependent upon senders' opinions rather than history, style, or so-called &quot;grade standards.&quot;

if a &quot;classsic&quot; becomes easier using new technique/trickery then it should be referred to using both grades. example &quot;the original Chili Sauce was put up w/out the use of the heel hook that has become standard today &amp; if you send it w/ the heel hook than it is NOT 9 points but instead only 7&quot; Some people physically can't use that beta because they can not reach it. i can and it is NO way off route. But it is different than the original beta and easier. 

there are lots of examples of climbs being down graded because the original beta wasn't the most efficient way up the rock. Trice in CO, whiplash @ pine mtn, smackdown @ black mtn, crouching tiger @tram, meathook in CO, lost in space @ jupiter's... Then there are the examples where being physically taller will drastically change the grade. Examples here are Mandala and Mandala sit, soul slinger @ milks and of course Chili Sauce to name a few.

the problem isn't that these climbs can be done using different beta but that kids take the higher grade and not what it really was.";"d16505534ff00f18e1cf8656c89df65a";"0";"Ag==";"317sc2w1";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

I climbed High Plains this year.  I'm pretty proud of myself.  If some kid tells me he did High Plains by using a fixed rope and some pulleys, I could care less.  He's obviously an idiot -- I don't need to run around making sure people know that he's not as good a climber as i am.

OK, InEpt, (so you're still around climbing, eh?) then if I do a problem in a way that is harder than it is rated, can I claim the extra points? I mean I can just remove holds and do it harder. Sweet. 

But seriously, the discussion is about the fact that plasticmullet thinks things like being a puss, cheating, or other wonderful terms are important to an ascent. Actually, the real discussion is that one CAN heel hook to do it the easiest. 

[fyi, I dont think meathook is downgraded because of different beta]

And if pm thinks using the heelhook makes one less of a person, then I think we all understand the position he holds. he's tough, rough, and simply badass cause he can do it the hard way. Whooohooow. And the real trajedy is that that thinking is so oldschool and destructive. I mean, did pm beat kids up in grammar school because they weren't cool? WTF? 

I personally don't give a fuck about what is classic or not. it you liked it, then cool. I do think style is important for a legitimate ascent, but beyond that it's moot, and most importantly, it doesn't matter either. The term 'Classic' is such a stupid term and fools like pm take it as gospel such that we need to set the style of ascent in stone (haha), to make it official and appease peeps like pm. I mean seriously, that's his argument. An argument that is sooooo supportive of the community. Your only point, pm, is that you're badass and others aren't if they diverge from your approach. 

&quot;I guess the truth hurts, you seem to be letting this get way under you skin. Sounds like you cheated and used the heel hook...good on ya.&quot;

your capacity to put others down when they ask for information/beta because they don't see things your way is what gets under my skin. And, yes, I cheated. I'm a cheater. I prefer to use my brain instead of my gonads!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! btw, do you have fake balls hanging from the back of your vehicle? just wondering.... Oh, the problem is simply not that cool, but since I'm a puss, I couldn't do it your way anyways. I mean, you are a badass! You are! Really, I admit it! 

regarding classics: why should the original ascent carry so much weight? isn't the line that was sent the real point? but we do need to discuss what exactly is a line (other than white shit on glass) because according to the seesaw logic of pm, it's the moves and holds and not the line, even if there is other stuff to use. But then again it's the acknowledgment that it's a classic so now that stuff like moves and holds are not important. What does &quot;hard&quot; have to do with classic? That means the real classics that are only v3 (white rasta), v4 (jerry's kids), v5/6 (planet x/so high) are not classic any more. I see. and all along I was so diluted and confused to think classic was something that was pioneering and replete with quality and timeliness. 

&quot;I think it's hard to argue that the probelm is not a classic...it's old school, hard, and represents &quot;early&quot; JT bouldering...it goes beyond the problem.&quot;

the best part is that this discussion is moot in regards to rope climbing. no matter how classic pm says anything might be, anyone doing it in better style, more efficiently and with less work gets the due credit to downgrade the line cause the FAist simply wasnt' good enough to figure it out. this occurred many times in rifle with all the &quot;hidden&quot; kneebars. I would like to see pm argue that we need to re-regrade rifle lines to be hard cause HE doesn't kneebar. Sweet. Talk about the most upsidedown logic... utter bullshit. I'm still a puss. and proud of it.";"1c31269f19f3a93093a0bb3211834db5";"0";;"zr4lddh5";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

What? miss out on doing something in a stupid fashion? What? envisioned? wholly hell are you embellishing this with some seriously profound bullshit. You outta work for citicorp or a lobby ground trying to fuck over americans. Get real. 

Who envisions anything? maybe a line, but not the moves. most peeps, from last I recall, try to actually work out the moves and send the problem asap. Where does the envisioning take place? Maybe, just maybe you are the only one that envisions these things. Aren't you, yet again, so badass. 

&quot;So Saty, continue to find the easy way in life and be content with being average.&quot;

Brilliant! I mean absolutely brilliant. How does one respond to that? Is it so wrong to find the easy way in life? is it so good to find the hard way in life? should I worry about being only average? should I try to more than average (I guess you are implying that you are more than average)? Actually, it's easy to answer them... if you are always seeking the hard way in life, I will be content to be a puss-seeking-easy-life kind of person and be content to be average since being more than average means I have to be like you. Simple. 

it's amazing how you subtly put down anyone that would want to heelhook; it's amazing how you think doing it the dumb and strong way as moffett is somehow better. (but it's only implied under the rules of classic lines, sorry forgot about your rules.)

So I will make an analogy: I want to pick up a heavy box, but I don't want to be a puss or cheat, SO, I use my back, straining it, to pick up the box because the safe and efficient way is the puss way to cheat. Thanks for clarifying things.

Personally, I don't like to heel hook, I just do it cause it suits the available holds to use something that's a foot reach away and is, if I remember correctly, two inches deep? Anyways, my position is to be knowledgeable of the original ascent, even repeat it as it was done, if possible and always try to climbing it in the best style and most balanced and efficient way. I think the problem is we see it from to very different point of views based on what you see as the sanctity of the original ascent. I'm not mocking you by saying that. I'm merely pointing out that you hold in great reverence the style demonstrated in the original ascent. Moffat (I apologize for not knowing the spelling) chose for unknown reasons not to heel hook, and that is important to you. What is important to me is that there is another way that is more efficient. 

I think such reverence is good and important, but I don't think the &quot;old school&quot; guys are infallible. If it's important to some peeps to remember the way it was done then so be it. Not my cup o' tea, at least not to any exacting or fundamental sense. There's a fine line concerning the differences in our views in that I would be so inclined to agree with you if I had to actually do a move or two to get to some holds, but i don't. The fact that I have to lift my leg to get the heal hook is the key movement in question, and I can see how someone with a strong and absolute view of the original ascent would simply not see it any other way, but I can also see how it makes no sense to say one body movement or another is disallowed just because Moffat chose to do something specific to reach up to potentially the same holds. But, if you heel hook you can reach farther left to lower and better initial holds followed by reaching all the way around to good holds. Or... you can continue up and reach the exact same holds used in doing the problem without heel hooking. So, is it wrong to move one body part over another? That thinking, though it defends the absolute style of the first ascensionist, is also self defeating in that it creates too strict a rule set on the climber's ability to move freely. 

If you want to stick to a strict interpretation of the traditional ascent then that's your thing. I think, in this case, such a strict interpretation also inhibits free body movement making it less meaningful. I'm more interested in pursing the experience within a simple set of rules governing whether there was any outside interference, or I used the ground to assist me. In general, I agree with how things are done in classic style, but on this one I don't. 

My apologies if I bummed you because chili sauce is important to you. But I can't disregard, even if Moffat disregarded it, an obvious hold to the left, and yet, you said you don't think that foot hold is obvious or easily accessible. To me it is, and that makes all the difference.";"064340e3a181b0e84c403adbf0ce8ae8";"0";;"cmkikvgo";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

If someone unlocks more efficient beta on line A-B-C, using same start holds A, same holds/foot features on path B, same finish/top-out C, that makes the problem easier than previously thought (based on their style, APE, height, strength, etc.), then this simply equates to a downgrade, yes?  So if someone unlocked new beta for Crouching Tiger at the Tram that now makes it a V4, then so be it. The original FAist who rated it V7 or whatever simply didn't consider certain movements on the same path other than the ones that he felt were best for himself and his style/abilities.  HOW you use the same available holds (using intermediates, skipping holds, whatever) on an established path should never matter as there is no &quot;tape&quot; indicating what holds to use and such.  And there are certainly no written or unwritten rules that say we need to honor the FAist by maintaining their original grade on the problem or that we need to do the line the exact same way they did it. And I might have missed it in reading, but how does anyone know for sure the exact sequence Moffat used to send Chili Sauce in the first place?

Honestly, if you ask any oldskooler &quot;Do I need to climb your problem the exact same way you did?&quot;, do you really believe they're gonna say YES? Or do you think they're gonna say something like &quot;Do it in a way that feels natural and suited to your own abilities&quot;.

If you wanna worship Moffat, Vaino, Bachar, etc., then fine.  Go climb with them, be their crash-pad bitch/picture bitch/gear bitch, jerk off to their pictures, sacrifice newborns at the start holds of their problems. I don't care but please keep your close-minded 'religious' ideals to yourself and let the rest of us climb (and heel hook) in peace. <!-- sfuckyou --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/boid[1].gif\" alt=\"fuckyou\" title=\"handgesture\" /><!-- sfuckyou -->";"61ac7a07e70f4fd45238ddbc9a2527f9";"0";"IA==";"1p29m1h4";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

To send the problem in the original style is a worthy pursuit, and he's the better person for doing it. But to demand that that be the only way is making the ascent a personal thing. pm and Lisa (among others) get high marks for avoiding the heelhook. 

I've always felt that a name given to a problem is a name given to the line. If the line is impure, and someone can use jugs off to the side to make the problem easier then I should have considered that and included it in the rating to accurately reflect that option. Eliminits are such BECAUSE an option exists. Why does slashface get so many stars? Well, there aren't any other options. the rock is quite stellar, and it's tall. It looks good, and it feels good to send, and it's a wonderful gateway for those wanting to do a tall problem.  Those that say chili sauce is not the best problem say so mostly, I would guess being that I'm from that crowd, because the line is marred by the jugs to the left side. I used them. Some don't. Had the line not be done 25+ years ago, it would have been a standard for 6 or 7 with the heel hook--given that most today would interpret that from the point of view of gym climbing, and heel hooks are standard fair today. Moffat did it, and so it goes that his style is the classic style of ascent. It does help to have such a stellar career and name; otherwise, I would say such a &quot;classic&quot; style would simply not exist on the problem. 

Alas, the problem has a classic style of ascent and a &quot;new wave&quot; style too. Lets call the heel hook line chili powder... I guess that could be controversial too, in that it takes away from moffat's ascent, and gives me perks I should never really have gotten. You be the judge (just don't rain on my parade.)

Ok. how about we talk controversy over another problem? Who thinks jbmfp deserves 7 stars and lhmfp deserves only 3 (or is it 4)? This is sexist, in my opinion. I enjoyed lh more then I did climbing jb, but then again I'm a guy, hmmmmmmmmm. I guess it's not that controversial. I'll try and find another one, darn.

1) Does anyone follow a regimented training schedule?  Simpler schedules I've seen go X weeks on, 1 week off.  Some other do different types of workouts through the schedule (endurance, aerobic, etc.), then finish, then repeat.

2) Does anyone try to take off a big chunk of time (a month or so) each year to recouperate?  I've heard it's good to take one month off from climbing each year to give your body a chance to catchup.

The max time I've ever taken off was two weeks -- once after I injured my shoulder at the tram, and once after I got a cortisone shot for the same shoulder 6 months afterwards.  It seems to be catching up to me since my injuries persist and I'm starting to look at long-term damage (especially for my shoulder).

Mondays - strength, strength-endurance, and power training, with every other Monday adding finger board or hangboard training
Tuesdays or Wednesdays - Gym bouldering on one day, the other day at 24-Hour Fitness for Opposition Training, Abs and Cardio
Thursdays - If I don't feel too sore, I'll do some leading and/or traversing the gym for endurance. 
Friday- Rest
Saturday or Sunday - Bouldering one day on the weekend, rest the other.  

I'll do this for the entire quarter, then take the first week of each quarter off.  Last time I took too much time off I had to retrain my fingers to crimp. No bueno.

As for the shoulder problem, I've had inflamatory issues in both shoulders since I was 18 (that's 14 years now) stemming from an older job at UPS. This unfortunately has completely altered my gym workouts i.e. no more bench pressing, military or overhead pressing, not to mention having to be very very careful doing any wide-grip pullups, and absolutely nothing with a barbell, ever, as it impinges the shoulder joint.  Luckily for myself and for my climbing, I can still do pushups, dips and pressdowns with little to no strain on the shoulder.  However I've NEVER had an issue with my shoulder while climbing.  I attribute that to the constant stretch your shoulders get when your arms are straightened out, not to mention the strengthening from all the pull-ups (the traps, rear delts, etc.). However it's important to note a few things for maintaining shoulder strength and health:

1. Stretch constantly.  While you're at work, sitting at the keyboard or just waiting for your turn on the boulder, stretch your shoulders out.  Never keep them still for too long.  Make it a habit to stretch and rotate often.

2. Do ALL those dorky exercises they tell you to do in physical rehab.  If you don't wanna look stupid laying down on your side rotating a dumbell, then find one of those newer stand-alone cable machines, fix your elbow against the handle bar and do the rotation exercises using the cable for resistance.

3. If you have to do military presses (to strengthen the anterior delts), keep the weight light and the reps high.  Avoid any kind of front raise exercise as they are generally bad for the shoulder.

4. If it wasn't obvious already, go to your local gym or buy some dumbells, and train your delts.  This should be part of your opposition training.

5. Make it a [i:20w0uu3e]habit[/i:20w0uu3e] to do all the above.

6. Save the Cortisone shots for when you're 90; you don't want to erode the shoulder before its time.  Unfortunately for me Cortisone is no longer an option as I've had 2 in my left and 3 in my right.  Your max EVER is gonna be 4...I think...  <!-- s:| --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_neutral.gif\" alt=\":|\" title=\"Neutral\" /><!-- s:| -->

I've managed to stave off shoulder pain for the last 10 or so years doing all the above, though it does come back from time to time when I get lazy and decide to sleep on my arm, sit too long at the computer, or get stupid at the gym and try to dumbell military press some obscene amount of weight.  But recurrence is once a year at most.  Wish I had a better answer than that but overall I would say adjusting your habits and consistent training is the key to preventing that shoulder from going to all hell.";"4f80fe6e8cf962f942c9bea26dd5953c";"0";"IA==";"20w0uu3e";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

It does but the side effect is that it erodes thus weakening the soft tissue, ligaments and tendons around the shoulder.  If I remember correctly, my doctor told me three shots in the same place is usually the limit, four is extreme and not recommended.  Essentially try to stay away from the stuff if you can help it and rely on ibuprofen (at least that'll only damage your liver...and you don't need a liver to climb  <!-- sjoe1 --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/biggrinjester[1].gif\" alt=\"joe1\" title=\"wiseguy\" /><!-- sjoe1 --> )";"7544ccd0962c7875d10149682d270580";"0";"gA==";"2qch0em5";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

Heretic, that's an important point, and here is my explanation of why things either seem to appear that way or just might be that way. First off, each crag has it's own style, or technical elements, required to move efficiently over that stone. Some stone has a higher capacity or need for friction, and the frictional characteristics can be different based on crystal size. This frictional component is very important in terms of footwork as it relates to angle of the wall. The higher the demand of shoe friction, the more relevant it is to wall angle (being that very friction-dependent footwork has a limited angle that's usable, josh being a good example). The different rock compositions also produce different types of holds, angles, and wall or &quot;panel&quot; like features (ie. some crags require a fairly high degree of turnout moves while another might not).

Now, looking at any one person's developed style and movement skills, would you think there would be compatibilities such that one might feel more confident, more capable or more suited to one crag over another? Imagine each crag being a separate school of training/style. Ask yourself, have you really masters this or that crag's special character or nature? 

Stretch is right, it's very subjective, but this subjectivity can be put into perspective by making sure you climb a diverse set of problems at any given crag for any given grade or grade range. 

Lets looks at a few crags and their specific nature. Joshua tree is often seen as a sandbag crag, but is it? The rock has mostly large crystals, offers very high friction capabilities for the shoes and hands, and is often times is in the sub vert to just overhung angle. As one can imagine, this demands a very high dependency on foot work and maximizing shoe friction. But the foot holds aren't always obvious and may be just flat smearing surfaces that seem quite steep to use effectively. Furthermore, hand hold types tend to be sloping, sometimes incut at odd places. Pinching is very important as is finger tip crystal pulling (where you actually place your finger tips up behind individual crystals and open crimp or open hand pull). But josh friction has more to do with the large crystals' very sharp edges rather than the surfaces of the crystals. That's why rubber is very effective on josh rock, but hands can be a fixed bag, especially if you try to just open smear the finger pads on the rock. Lets contrast this with yosemite granite (tram and black mtn are similar with the tram being the most different). The ditch has mostly flat crimps, very technical angles (not unlike josh), small holds that require fingertip pulling without the high surface area/friction one might get in josh. the ditch is also very temperature and humidity dependent where even just a mild breeze can make a big difference. The rock simply isn't very frictiony, or feels greasy, unless conditions are just right. In the sun, it can be down right terrible.  The nature of the edges demands very precise body positioning unlike other crags. Foot holds tend to be very small requiring a fair amount of toe strength whereas josh usually requires broad foot smearing (basically trying to maximize surface area)

My point is that there is a unique relationship between rock type, angles available and hold shapes that are all dependent on the weather patterns of that area during the in season. Whatever your inherent ability is, finding out your &quot;real&quot; limits demands a fairly healthy amount of climbing on that particular stone. 

Now lets look at a persons' own experiences: lets profile a typical gym climber who learned but hasn't refined their skills yet and another who has refined their skills in the same gym. The first climber is beginning to learn how climbers move: turn out, weighting one foot, flagging for balance and support, locking off, dynoing, momentum dynoing, turn in moves like drops and backsteps, etc. Though this climber has reached a point of understanding for the language of movement, they haven't yet become efficient at their gyms' style of movement: setting, wall angle and hold choice. In essence, this person is not so &quot;molded&quot; or &quot;pre-set&quot; to move or pull according to a fixed set of variables... his/her gym. But this person as learned one thing, that learning in the gym usually is learning to stand on fairly large or incut footholds. The later person has already made movement on his/her gym terrain second nature. This means, any new terrain, he/she has to relearn and rediscover new parameters that might be outside his/her experience. Ironically, the latter person is more &quot;biased&quot; towards a certain type of climbing. The former is more malleable. Also, as problems get harder in the gym, they usually get so by way of worse hand holds: smaller and/or slopier. Usually, difficulty is not based on foot hold size or shape, or even movement. This means the first mistake a gym climber learns is to trust their feet too much, push off them, and just think of pulling WITHOUT regard to their balance; balance being something you deal with if you hit the target hold (ie, desire to hang on). But learning to stand on your feet on micro footholds, or very smeary faces demands a high degree of balance--something rarely learned in gyms.

The irony is the first person might &quot;accept&quot; the new demands of an outside crag sooner and learn to work with it while the latter person finds themselves trying to &quot;live up&quot; to their old standard in the gym. This means they will start to seek out problems that favor their skill set and level of performance. For josh, there are some gym-style problems: nicole overhang, bittersweet (minus the mantel), thin lizzy, caveman, scatterbrain, chili sauce, flight attendant, etc. These typically have good landings and mild topouts, but they don't represent the typical josh problem. Ironically, though gym climbing has a huge potential for variation, it, often times, ends up being very narrow in it's movement variation. And the biggest drawback with gym climbing is the lack of new and refreshing wall angles and profiles. These angles and profiles can become second nature to an experienced gym climber such that new angles can totally shut that person down. 

Ask yourself if you mentally have a harder time with scary topouts, or bad landings while bouldering. In other words, are you more emotionally effected by risk elements? 

The problem database is an attempt to give a mathematical rating to a consensus opinion. It's a way to separate yourself form the number as this number includes many opinions. Is midnight lightning v8 or 9? well, I bet it's somewhere in the low eight point rating since many seem to agree with the v8 rating it was first given after the B rating system was dropped. Also, shorter peeps might rate it higher. The climb favors being tall or at least lanky. 

Movement is based on developing core strengths, primary pulling/pushing strengths and finger strength. yet all of this means little without a sense of balance and finding as much equilibrium as possible. Without balance, one is using far more energy just to maintain position let alone advancing upwards. Gym climbing or hueco problems tend to be about grabbing good holds and pulling your way up. Often, hueco is seen as overrated, but the irony is it's not. It's a crag that just happened to be most like the gym before gyms were created. The gym forces a climber, because of setting limitations, to learn to develop primary muscles over technical concerns. Hueco suits that style perfectly. hueco isn't overrated, it's the real thing, but it seems so because we climb that style all the time. What if you spent that much time in the  gym climbing vert sloping walls? I bet you'd bet pretty good at font climbing without ever going there. 

The point is that sandbag and overrated problems that aren't done intentionally are more often related to the climber than the climb. Ask yourself: is this the type of movement I practice? Have I truly maxed out my capacity to use feet? Is my core weak (ie, feet cut loose all the time in the gym)? Am I intimidated by the line and fall line? 

I personally find josh not to be sandbag, but then again I spend a lot of time there and often challenge myself on the classic lines that are VERY technical. I might flash a v8 but spend an hour trying to send a v4. Why? Because I have to learn it first. The 8 was gym ready, but the 4 was all new to me. I then confirm this by seeing if I can send the 4 over and over even when I'm tired. If I can, I bet it really is 4, and I've finally mastered it. 

I'm really tired of writing, so I'll leave it as is and update the post if necessary.

Maybe I just have a bias toward JTree and the type of climbing it has to offer.  I would say I do experience 'mental cruxes' when climbing certain problems but have never let that keep me off the problem.  I had a bad splatter off of White Rastafarian last year but managed to get over it by the following weekend.  Eventually sending that problem, though not my most difficult send, was my most satisfying thus far.  However 'being scared' I think was natural for me, which is one of the main reasons I chose to work that line.  The idea of mastering your fear to attain something you desire has thus far been an unequaled motivator.

I appreciate the ability to contribute and review consensus grades on the problemdb, and to get opinions from so many climbers with a broad range of experience.  I only question the obvious (and unfortunate) possibility of 'ego stroke'; problems being overrated simply for the sake of someone saying they sent a &quot;V-whatever&quot;.  Now that the problemdb has the ability to keep a scorecard like 8gay.fu, there appears to be more incentive for those who contribute to the problemdb to overrate.

Again thanks for the insight, I will think more on it and reply back.

We met with John Ladley, Recreation Office, and Andy Smith, Assistant Recreation Office (see the Super Topo link in a previous post for more on Andy's work at Taquitz). Both were not only friendly, and seemed to truly care about the mountains, but were also open to reasonable suggestions for change. Here's the cliff notes version of the meeting, in ascending order of importance:

1. John and Andy didn't know about the dirt road to the Republic, so there is little chance of it being cleaned up any time soon. Ah well, real men have trucks anyway.

2. Of course you need an adventure pass to park on the road, but the Golden Eagle Pass - or what do they call it now, the &quot;America the Beautiful Interagency Access Pass&quot; (how lovingly bureaucratic) - also works. Just put it on the windshield. 

3. Parking in the campground with an adventure pass is allowed (although I've heard reports to the contrary in the past), just don't do it on a busy weekend when you may be taking sites away from campers. Use common sense.

4. There are some pictographs around OK Corral. We've all seen them, but I just assumed it was paint from the 70s or something. We were first told to enjoy them and then to respect them. Remember Hueco, and be kind to the writing on the rocks.

5. The lower gate is closed to prevent people from trashing the road and getting stuck when there is mud and snow. But as we pointed out, the road below the Corral - and to a large extent the campground as well - dries out early in the season. We suggested that another gate be added directly above the Corral or the campground, and John and Andy were both open to it. [b:1dhut2w0]HEAR THAT! WE COULD HAVE NEARLY YEAR ROUND BLACK MOUNTAIN ACCESS![/b:1dhut2w0]

A second gate isn't a done deal by any means, but the possibility is a live one. It needs to get cleared by the fire people, and someone has to pay for it (perhaps $3,000), but there may soon come a day when the summer is Black Mountain's off season.

Anyways, feel free to chime in on the most fickle bouldering crag around. Blacks might be up there too, but haven't been in so long, and usually always limited to shit weather (late spring and summer) anyways, I could be wrong about that. 

And to add to that... it might be that granite is the most fickle of crags to climb at. Squam is a bit more tolerant, but I think that's more to do with continuous prevailing winds that keeps the boulders aired out moreso than blacks or da ditch. 

On another note: what's the most consistent granite crag around, and most consistent crag regardless of stone?

ps. IMHO all the major crags accessible for the bay area cuties are at least 3 hours away... anyone want to correct me on that... cause all I know is da ditch and tahoe. I'd say that makes their weekend approaches a grade 3, going to the east side being a grade 2 and anything under 2 hours a grade 4, anything under an hour a grade 5. So what is a grade 1?

Yeah I know easy beta for that climb.  So what you do is you kinda bear hug for the start and you get a right heel/toe cam and go up with the right hand.  The trick for this first move is to paste your left foot a little higher than you think and rock up into the cam to reach the first hold (this hold is not as good as the one right above it, but it helps if you can't reach the good one).  After this you bump to the better hold, match, than either bump right hand one more time and go big to the jug or just go big from the match ; ]
After that its pretty much done.  This method is a little tweaky, but give it a good amount of attempts its much easier than the Craig way for sure.

Hope that clears it up, if not let me know...

Some other beta; I was climbing with a really tall guy today.  He did some interesting shit.  Start both hands on each corner of the big block, then heel hook/calf scum on the left corner of the block (left start hold).  Nice and controlled left-hand static reach to the middle crimp.

I tried this today with the kneebar without much success as it doesn't seem as my leg is long enough for it?  Probably just bad foot placement. However I did try something else; using the jugs inside the offwidth.  There were ample holds to get you up to second rail, however if you reach up a bit higher, you can get a sweet-ass hand jam at the very top of the offwidth, good enough to rest on and get to the very last rail at the top, then traverse right to the topout.

With all that, I'm wondering if this becomes now a question of efficiency or is this just one of many variations on this same problem.  Damon (Corso?)'s version looks to be V4 or harder, the rails + the kneebars also appears to be about V4.  However the offwidth jugs and handjam doesn't feel anymore than easy-moderate V3.  Has anyone else gone up the offwidth the same way?  If so what's your take?

Then slaped around right to the sloper, and established my feet to go right again the the gaston.  Match and go for the jug.  For some unknown reason I topped out to the left onto the sketchy, mossy slab above the dead tree.  Not hard, but scary.  Later RTM figured out that you could mantle straight up from the jug.  As for the grade I don't really know. RTM rated it V7 in the guide, but it could be easier with different beta. From reading the posts it seems everyone other than the ridicuously strong Craig Gilbert pretty much did it ithe same way.  Let's call it B1 and move on.  Always thought it was a pretty cool problem though.  Don't over look the slabs on the other side of the boulder.  Good fun.

The biker pulled over and said, &quot;Thank you, Lord. Please build a bridge to Hawaii so I can ride over anytime I want.&quot;

The Lord said, &quot;Your request is materialistic. Think of the enormous undertaking; the supports required to reach the bottom of the Pacific, and the concrete and steel it would take! It will nearly exhaust several natural resources. I can do it, but it is hard for me to justify your desire for worldly things. Take a little more time and think of something that could possibly help mankind.&quot;

The biker thought about it for a long time. Finally, he said, &quot;Lord, I wish that I, and all men, could understand our wives; I want to know how she feels inside, what she's thinking when she gives me the silent treatment, why she cries, what she really means when she says nothing's wrong, and how I can make a woman truly happy.&quot;

 ex. LA country, Riverside County, Orange County. And in this way, the sierra section- which covers over 400 miles in length, would be cut into smaller regional sections which would allow easier searching. 
And a tangent, if we used the GPS locations for sites, couldn't we just type in our zip code and get a list of bouldering destinations near us? that would be really cool.

2. If there is a page up with limited information/description, allow it to be edited, far too many of the pages lack enough information to get a feel about or even find the site. example, look at LA/Orange county, not only is it two vast areas but there is no information on the area in terms of people, where to go &amp; when, transportation, geology, etc.";"35a0a74fcc4007bb234e98fe38dede45";"0";;"2olvsu2m";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

 ex. LA country, Riverside County, Orange County. And in this way, the sierra section- which covers over 400 miles in length, would be cut into smaller regional sections which would allow easier searching. 
[/quote:2dzss4he]
Wouldn't this just create more confusion?  I honestly don't know what county Yosemite is in...or Castle Rock.  (I know a few guys who wouldn't know what county Steele Valley is in).  I'm fine with re-org'ing the top layer, but county name won't do it.

[quote=&quot;Tattvamasi&quot;:2dzss4he]And a tangent, if we used the GPS locations for sites, couldn't we just type in our zip code and get a list of bouldering destinations near us? that would be really cool.[/quote:2dzss4he]
You find me a GPS-to-zip code database and I'll see what I can do...

[quote=&quot;Tattvamasi&quot;:2dzss4he]2. If there is a page up with limited information/description, allow it to be edited, far too many of the pages lack enough information to get a feel about or even find the site. example, look at LA/Orange county, not only is it two vast areas but there is no information on the area in terms of people, where to go &amp; when, transportation, geology, etc.[/quote:2dzss4he]
Hah!  I was just thinking about this yesterday.  Yeah, the original idea was that only admins and the original author can edit things, but the more and more I see &quot;Needs description&quot; (I'm guilty as well), the more I think we need a more wiki-like site.  In order to do it right, I'll need to keep revisions, which is no small task, so give me some time, but it'll come.

There will be some changes and improvements made.  First up will be addressing some safety concerns on the topout bouldering areas and repairing the broken vertical lift door at the entry of the gym.  Also, some minor cosmetic and layout changes here and there in the gym.

Ultimately, there will be a new upper level above the bathrooms and some additional climbing terrain and modifications, but these are down the road a little bit.

For now, the entire bouldering area is being reset with new problems (and a lot of new holds).  The roped walls will come next...";"d7246101f26414232843f422b94e2716";"0";;"1dy4navg";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

I started to do some work on allowing all users to modify any section of the site.  In order to not create a total anarchist state, I'd need to implement a &quot;revisions&quot; system, so we could easily roll back unwanted changes and see what users edited.

Despite my initial thoughts, this is actually a pretty significant change to the site -- all descriptions would need to reference a different database table, as well as editing pages, RSS feeds, etc.  In addition, I'd need to create a mechanism for admins to review/compare/rollback previous versions.  

So -- I am *still* going to do it, because I agree with the idea completely.  I just need to find a spare weekend or two to implement the feature.  Gimme a month or two and you guys can edit till your hearts content.  

Cheers.  And thanks for using the problemDB:

I had done some problems a while ago (ten years ?) that I never realized were FA's until Hensell and Powell told me as much when we were all out there last year.  They are down at the Wild West area on a solitary boulder.  One climbs the steep left arete and the other climbs the OH face to its right.  Both are pretty good and quite different from the normal dime-fests that hill is known for.  If you're looking for more to do at the Rube, you should look down there as there are a few obvious (scary) highball things still to do.

power balance (really not a good problem) is in between emerald city and the roof v7 behind it. . Hard Slab problem with funky fall. If you fall left, you'll tumble down somewhere near the start of emerald city. You fall right and you end up near the stand start of the roof problem. Not very good, but pretty scary.

Someone at work told me they we're going to close a bunch of California parks, and said Malibu Creek was on the list of parks that will go. The scary thing is the article says it could happen starting labor day?? I don't even know when labor day is! This is the only link I read so far about it, so if anyone has additional info or updates let us know. I wonder how serious they are or whats been done to convince them to leave the creek alone.

Now, here's what I don't know -- does this mean closed as in &quot;not kept up anymore, and if you get on the land, you're trespassing&quot;  or closed as in &quot;we're not managing the place anymore, but whatever it's kinda like BLM land now&quot; ?

Speculation seems to be that the amenities would be shut down. No toilets, camping, water. Some of the parks on the list see very few visitors, but in Malibu Creek's case it would cost more to enforce a complete closure than it would to keep it open. There are too many ways into the park, and too many cooler totting families to let it be open space ala BLM.

Here's your science fact for the day:  temperature drops 3 degrees for every thousand feet of elevation.   So Valley station is about 2600' and ranger station is 8400' ... so say 6000' feet?  aka 18 degree difference from top to bottom.

Just like that, after all we've been through, you're ready to just bail.

And on the that note I'll get back to the point of this thread. Since the industry I work in has been put on hold until people are ready to spend boat loads of money on luxuries. I have taken up Hobo (different from bum or tramp. Hobo is short for &quot;Hoe Boy&quot; which came from migrant farmers during the Great Depression and refers to one that travels for work, just so you know) status and found work on the east side. Leaving this weekend and hopefully riding out our &quot;Great Recession&quot;. I got super lucky and got a gig that will pay me more than I've ever been paid and I get to live somewhere that I love to live with people that I love to live with.I'll be in Swall Meadows so I doubt I'll have any run ins with any of you, but hopefully I'll see some of you guys out at the crags this fall and maybe some Way lake sessions this summer. Aron is cruising up and you should too. I'll be on a job site with a couple of guys that are workhorses so I will greatly appreciate the company.

The Front Range in Colorado was probably the only other place in North America where bouldering was as well integrated into the regular practice of elite rock climbing.  Even in the 1980s, bouldering was a pretty marginal sport, something done maybe at the end of the day while drinking beers or as a substitute for &quot;real&quot; climbing.

Bachar, like Largo, made it one of his specialties.   The high balls, including those that blur the line between bouldering and soloing, are best known.   But many of his best technical problems were really memorable.  The original line of Caveman, right to left, done in EBs with the toe hook, was a pioneering line, as were many of his other creations.

Aside from simply taking bouldering seriously; climbing bold lines; and creating visionary technical routes, Bachar was also important for the style of his movement.   Bouldering was an art form, and flailing-- grunting, scraping, shaking --was a form of failure.  His preferred motion was always smooth, measured, and controlled.

these two are just east of group campsite four (not in boulder basin) on the way to fuller ridge. you basically park, and walk away from the direction that the cliff-like boulder with one bolt on top is.  theres a small hill and a set of small pancake stack boulders are up there.  these two are near each other.

ANND on this one the waterstreak to the left has some fairly moderate (if abundunt) crimps. the dishes are good for some v0 v1 sequences depending on which way you go...  theres also some hard crimpy problems on the left side and a slab on the opposite side of this boulder.

They then proceeded to fill the space with climbing walls and had their own mini-gym. That original facility (Slo-Op 1) was enjoyed by many and they even hosted some competitions. One day the inevitable happened though and they had to tear down their walls.

The main users took the tear down in stride and did not give up. Instead they rented a larger commercial space and built a far larger version of what they used to enjoy. After a couple of years, the number of people using this new Slo-Op 2 facility was far larger than what was ever envisioned and so once again it was time to move.

Construction is now drawing to a close on Slo-Op 3, and they went big this time. Well over 3000 square feet of top-notch bouldering terrain will be suplemented by a dedicated slackline area, a campus board, and an adjustable crack machine. The bouldering terrain is where the new Slo-Op really shines though. There is a good mix of angles (including plenty of steep terrain)on which to climb and almost everything offers top-out options to better simulate the outdoor bouldering experience. The walls are tall too. Many of them topout between 14 and 16 feet above the floor.

Regardless of your climbing ability or angle preference you should check the place out. If you're within a couple of hours drive from San Luis Obispo, it would be well worth the drive to climb on these boulders. If you live closer, you should be very happy because you have a wonderful new facility in which to climb. I only wish it was a few hours closer to home for me.

Don't worry about losing strength or technique.  I've felt maybe a little sluggish coming back from a break, especially the first day back after a week or so off, but you'll be back at full strength in no time.  I generally feel like it takes me about as much time (climbing regularly) as I took off to gain all my strength back which is really a small price to pay for taking some much needed rest.  For example, if I take a week off, it usually takes me a full week (climbing maybe 4 times) to feel like I've regained all my strength.  I have also lost most aches and pains or illnesses in that time though so definitely worth it.";"4488b4ed2a341dfc5d8b93d559c636fe";"0";;"13ouxcpc";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

Not good news.  Aspendale is just north of the Buttermilks on the 168.  I was just there a week ago and the blistering heat would be perfect for a fire.  Hopefully no serious damage.  We'll keep you posted as I try and find out more.

What does this include?  The holds only?  Most of those holds look like small crimps.  I think motivationally this would get old.  I was able to download some of the problem setup and the directions of the holds are navigational only (ie. north, south, southwest, etc.).  That doesn't leave much room for tweaking if you're really wanting to keep problems exactly the same.  For instance, you'll find that turning a hold only a few degrees can often be the difference in awkward or not or the difference in sending or not.  

It will probably get you stronger, but I think the most common problem with home walls is staying motivated.  This is in my opinion hindered by never changing the problems, holds that are too similar or lack variety, not being creative, and uniform t-nut placement.  This last one is key in my opinion, but often overlooked.  If you want a system board then uniform t-nuts (placed in rows with equal distance from each other) like the Moon system calls for is probably a good thing.  But for a fun home woody, randomly placing lots of t-nuts leaves more to the imagination, yields less consistent (read: boring) problems, and thus creates a more motivating and fun wall.";"4b6578553b7cd0f09aed37b5a1b1198d";"0";;"2l10uwt2";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

The most critcal factor in a home wall is keeping it interesting.  It's always fun and new at first, but after a while it can get stale due to the limited space.  I try to compltetly strip, and clean all the holds on my walls at least 3 or 4 times a year.  Here's the kicker.  In the alomost 8 years I've had my wall I've found the most fun way to set problems is to just put up all your holds up in random positions on the wall.  At this point it's like a blank canvas, and you can put up problems as you see them.  No forced movement, and to me it always feels like your doing a new problem.  Similar to FA's outside.  You see the moves, and envision the problems.  Much more fun than forcing the movement, and trying to be creative all the time.

- not that great for smearing, especially when faily new
- the rubber on the top of the toe box tends to peel off of the leather if you toe hook alot (or even a little if done aggresively enough) and thereafter just rolls on you if you try to toe hook, neccesitating that you just cut it off.
- there is a stitch in the interior of the shoe that runs straight down the heel of your foot. In 2 of 4 pairs that I have owned, this stitch has worn through and seperated, making the shoe very uncomfortable. This has only happened after the shoe rubber was very worn but, nonetheless, I now don't feel the shoes are worth resoling.


That is about all I could come up with. Aside from smearing, the shoes perform superbly. On very steep rock they are very nearly amazing. I like. I have, after all, purchased 4 pairs despite those complaints. The velcro closure works great and the shoes fit very comfortably on my feet almost immeadiatly. As far as sizing, I wear Solutions in the same size as Katanas and 1/2 size larger than Miuras.";"3ef5d9a4d48e255d8b66fff844821d5b";"0";;"3bw3awzp";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

The key thing for me is that I've landed on a couple of Organics and they are pretty stiff.  I actually landed square in the middle of one and sprained my ankle (not an ackward landing in any way, but it was so stiff I might as well have landed on the ground...).  Maybe it needed to be broken in more or whatnot, but my experience is that they are a bit too stiff for me.  

Just make sure that you get what you are looking for...do you want just a crasher or do you want one with functional aspects to it?  For example, do you want extra handles? Pockets?  Do you intend on stuffing gear inside it? A flap at the bottom so if you stuff gear in between it won't fall out?  A flap on the side for the same reason?  Do you care about metal buckles or how the thing locks down? Oh...do you intend to highball it?

If you don't care about most of that, go with the cheapest thing out there...I believe it's the Mad Rock Double Fold?  It serves its intended purpose rather well for the price.  If you want functionality, save some cash and go higher end.  My fav so far is the Black Diamond Drop Zone and Mondo.  If you can wait til Xmas, you may find some SWEET internet deals...or if you can get it wholesale through your gym then go for it.

I'll be gettin up to black on friday morning and try to get the free group site #4/5. We are unsure if we should bring a pony keg or full keg this year. We have yet to actually finish a full size one during this event ( some will find this sad). But either way, there will be lot's of climbing, good times around the campfire with good people (with free beer), and then more good climbing. 

It's only bouldering around the camping areas, however a short drive to Idyllwild will give you much taller pieces of granite (but you all should know this).

(check this link for info, maps, and pics of the place)

Directions:
-From the 10 freeway, 
-exit 8th st. (highway 243) and head south
-left on Lincoln St.(highway 243)
-Right on San Gorgonio Ave (highway 243) head up the mountain for about 15 miles
-Left at Black Moutain Sign. (there are 2 - don't go to the trail head   parking lot, go to the second sign.) Take this dirt road for about 5 miles staying left at the fork in the road. Pass a sign that points to boulder basin campground on the left down a short road. Our campsite should be about a mile further down the road. If you get to a gated group campground you're almost there. Pass this campground and go uphill around a couple turns and a large pullout should be on your left. These are campsites 4 and 5 and you should find us here.

High clearance not needed but drive slow if you don't have it. 

Any questions, my # is 949.244.5229

Directions to certain boulders are almost impossible.  Even with a map I had from the SD guidebook, it's incredibly difficult to find stuff.  I'd suggest staying towards the bottom of the hill near the Warm Up Boulders or the Sunday Afternoon Boulder.  If you've got time on your hands (to get a little lost), I always take new-comers to Big Horn.  It's got a ton of great problems on it. (see link below)

Again, directions are tough.  So here's some GPS for ya.  Go grab Google Earth and you'll figure it all out.

Parking:
 33.007912°, -116.955391°

Warm Up Boulders
 33.006329°, -116.960217°

Sunday Afternoon Boulder (a few easy roped climbs)
 33.006235°, -116.961003°

TV Screen (hard lieback on right arete):

Painted Boulder (fun 5.10 dime-edgey thing on the West face):
 33.004839°, -116.965991°

Robbins Crack (yes, Royal Robbins.  amazing 5.10 hand crack):
 33.005595°, -116.965841°

...if you're at the base of Robbins Crack, there's a few fun and tall 5.10's directly behind you:

 33.007025°, -116.967141°

Baby Robbins (fun 5.9 fingers):
 33.005817°, -116.967082°

Jaws (painful 5.10/5.11 fingers, but mega-classic):
33.005795°, -116.967455°

Hamburger Crack (short, roadside):

(just down the road from Hamburger Crack)

Big Grunt (tall 5.9 chimney in a huge boulder)
 33.007791°, -116.967595°

The Cave (one of my fav's.  v2/3 roof into a tall 5.11):

Stairway to Heaven
 33.007392°, -116.969455°

Big Horn (i could spend all day on this boulder)
<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.westcoastbouldering.com/problemdb/section/view/155/Big-Horn\">http://www.westcoastbouldering.com/prob ... 5/Big-Horn</a><!-- m -->
 33.007644°, -116.970474°

Also - wear light pants.  You might end up doing some bushwacking, and you're best to avoid the cuts and sometimes poison oak.

Reply to this post with a caption to the picture below.  150 character max.

Rules:
1. Only one entry per person.  If you post again, only your first entry will count...so don't bother.
2.  Don't cheat.  I can't figure out how you could, but just don't be a jerk.
3.  No inside jokes.  If it's not funny to everyone, it's not funny ... and you won't win.
4.  The winner will be determined by the admins of WCB (and maybe supertopo, since they donated the books).

This contest will run from Wednesday, September 9th through Friday, September 18th.  The winner will be announced within a week after that.

I am so glad someone out there agrees...  and i love natural lens abberation (i.e. crappy medium format cameras) I really like how the spotters leg and body (both in the same focal plane) are at different focuses...  I prefer to just use paint to create a spotlight effect...

There are a couple of lines on this face, one VBish warmup on the right side, and a potential steep crimpfest on the opposite side.

It was chossy when we found it, had to clean up the landing area a bit, no other signs of human activity.  Just wanted to confirm prior to entering in the DB.  Thanks~";"92c0e2012c249091b27093936f803fec";"0";"CA==";"12d8ddra";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

So we all must act accordingly.

But to get around that, we use clear and simple Scotch Tape.  <!-- sjoe1 --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/biggrinjester[1].gif\" alt=\"joe1\" title=\"wiseguy\" /><!-- sjoe1 -->

The use of Scotch Tape is incredibly advantageous for problem repair as it allows us to work the problem with the repaired hold, and then (here's the big kicker) allows for easy removal of the broken hold with minimal/no trace on either the boulder/face or the broken piece.  Just please remember to be considerate; pack out your used Scotch Tape and leave the broken hold near the problem for others to tape up.

How to Play:
Reply to this post with a caption to the picture below.  150 character max.

Rules:
1. Only one entry per person.  If you post again, only your first entry will count...so don't bother.
2.  Don't cheat.  I can't figure out how you could, but just don't be a jerk.
3.  No inside jokes.  If it's not funny to everyone, it's not funny ... and you won't win.
4.  The winner will be determined by the admins of WCB (and maybe supertopo, since they donated the books).

This contest will run from Friday, August 28 through Thursday, September 3rd.  The winner will be announced within a week after that.

Prize: 
There will be a few more of these contests.  For this one, we'll start out with:  1 copy of either NorCal Bouldering or Tuolumne Boudlering, and also a copy of Zion Free and Clear  (all courtesy of [url=http&#58;//supertopo&#46;com:21qtmrt8]supertopo.com[/url:21qtmrt8])

My street shoe size is ~9.5 and I wear my solutions at 38.

I think they run a little smaller than the other shoes as my cobras in a size 37.5 slide on with ease..  Best to just go in somewhere and try them out though if you can.

I used to own the Metolious Cheap Bastard (<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.spadout.com/p/metolius-cheap-bastard/\">http://www.spadout.com/p/metolius-cheap-bastard/</a><!-- m -->)
Pros
* light
* cheap
* decent construction (never ripped for me)
* angled hinge (you'll find the Mad Rock just has a straight hinge, which is fairly dangerous)

Cons
* hinged in the middle -- angled or not, it freaked me out
* because of that hinge, it was awkward to lay against something like a boulder at your back.  if it didn't fit perfectly, it'd just close shut
* because of the hinge, if i wanted to stuff crap inside, it'd end up with a fat, awkward bulge

...so to combat those Cons, I bought the Black Diamond Impact (<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.bouldering.com/products/Black-Diamond-Impact-Crash-Pad.html\">http://www.bouldering.com/products/Blac ... h-Pad.html</a><!-- m -->)

Pros
* no hinge -- which solves all my previous cons
* still relatively cheap

Cons
* the buckles kinda suck, but not a huge deal

I remember a crash pad review in Climbing Mag in 2007 -- they picked Organic as #1.  I can't find the article online, but here's the final review for the Organic Pad: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.organicclimbing.com/images/editorschoice.pdf\">http://www.organicclimbing.com/images/editorschoice.pdf</a><!-- m -->";"0cab4092186fa59c7797b308b1e71e4c";"0";;"jsdyfrgo";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

They all work well at first, but the organic is the only pad that lasts.  The madrock pads are cheap but if you climb alot they could be worn out in as little as 3-6 months.  I probably climb outside about 100-125 days per year and my organic has lasted for over 2 years and that's before Josh's new foam (which he thinks will last longer than the old stuff).  Also the center hinge combined with the continuous top sheet makes the pad almost as sturdy as a taco style pad, but doesn't give you problems when you go to lay it out.  Also you are able to adjust (at least on my pad) where the straps are on the pad, so you can carry it higher on your back if you're short, or lower if you're tall.

Mondo's are absurd... i don't know what's up with the round edges; it basically means if you have multiple pads as a landing, you are guaranteed to have ankle breaking gaps between pads.

I know this sounds like an organic plug, because, well, it is.  All the other pads are just expensive carpet...";"9a2f30b91084a6363fa0b177c1e9a9cb";"0";;"24cfdjug";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

My names Marky Im 23 years old and newly into climbing, mainly bouldering due to money restraints. I live about 2 miles from Mt. Rubidioux and tend to climb there with a couple friends. Ive been looking into climbing somewhere else and was looking for some tips. I dont have a legit crash pad and climb at 0-2 level of difficulty depending on the situation. My friends and I use a piece of foam and are currently in the process of hopefully getting a good pad soon. So my question is where is a good place to go for us? We tried Steele Valley on Sunday and couldnt really find aything very well and ended up giving up due to the excessive heat there. I wouldnt mind going with anyone willing to share beta and any advice and help are always greatly appreciated. I climb Thresh Hold alot and if you would like to meet there and get to know each other before going outdoors im fine with that. Anyways thanks for taking the time to read this. I look forward to meeting some if not all of you eventually and climbing all these good places you all talk about.

There is plenty of room for new problems, especially at V4 and up, as I don't climb much harder than V4/V5. As always I am stoked to point folks towards developing new problems. Bear Valley is loaded with untapped stone which a few of you have tasted this summer since the new Supertopo &quot;NorCal Bouldering Guide&quot;.

Also folks have been contacting us about the weather for this weekend. Yes there is a small cold front coming in Saturday evening and Sunday. We are not expecting this to effect the Saturday competition. In fact the cool and breezy condition will be optimal for bouldering with daytime temps in the mid-50's &amp; low-60's. I'm not sure I could have asked for better weather to make the shoes stick without the fingers getting cold!

Echo Cove is right off the road so not sure if there would be a long hike to any of that stuff. Park in front of the cove and walk north, in the small canyon left of the Cove proper. Scramble up into the rocks above/behind the cove (5min walk). The problems are scattered about. Mostly easy stuff there, but cool hueco'd out rock.

Couple things about the new homepage/database:  
How long are you gonna keep up the &quot;latest news&quot; stuff? There's posts from 2 months ago!  Seems like the page will just get longer and longer too.

I miss the new problems section, or latest comments from the actual database section on the homepage...this was the easiest way to check for new stuff.

Analytics shows you're not the only one -- 95% of views come from the ProblemDB and the Forum.

[quote:3dkv3zfx]How long are you gonna keep up the &quot;latest news&quot; stuff? There's posts from 2 months ago!  Seems like the page will just get longer and longer too.[/quote:3dkv3zfx]

Nope.  It's dynamically generated from ProblemDB and Forum happenings -- the list only contains a certain amount of items (and is capped at that number

[quote:3dkv3zfx]I miss the new problems section, or latest comments from the actual database section on the homepage...this was the easiest way to check for new stuff.[/quote:3dkv3zfx]

This data is still there.  In the &quot;Latest News&quot; section click &quot;Areas/Problems&quot; or &quot;Comments&quot;  -- this will show you the exact same data you're mentioning.

They are separated -- click any of the filters below the &quot;latest news&quot; header and it will only show those items that you want to see.  (I'll make this area more noticeable if you think it's hard to see).";"4d414e8c6fdeaf900c85f1fd025984e6";"0";"gA==";"3dkv3zfx";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

As you drive into the parking lot, on the far end to the left there is a little extension to the lot. At the very end of that lot, there is a climb right off of the lot and right by a table. The climb is maybe 8 or so feet high and is facing the main road. It starts matched on a good crimp/pinch at about stomach height and moves up and left to a good crimp. You then need to make a big reach over a bulge to a long horizontal sloping crimp with a good gaston on the right side of it. Then move up to sloping lip that is angling up and right.

There is a lot of rock and a lot of projects cause no one climbs there.  Due to a lot of prescribed burns down there, some of the rock is crumbly choss.  Check it out first. Most of the quality probs are near [b:1zobg123]Roads End [/b:1zobg123]parking lot and [b:1zobg123]Zumwalt Meadows[/b:1zobg123] parking lot.  If you walk up [b:1zobg123]Paradise Valley trail[/b:1zobg123] for one mile (maybe less) there is a good group of boulders. 

If you walk and explore you could find some real gems. Take a brush.

However, I [i:1ef7bqg8][b:1ef7bqg8]did[/b:1ef7bqg8][/i:1ef7bqg8] find the silhouetted problem! Since half these problems are in the Hidden Valley Campground, I figured it would be right around there.

Approach: Hidden Valley Campground, Site #21 (couple of sites up from Stem Gem). Look to the right toward the big slab wall.

Description: A thin, crimpy, overhung arete.  Once you get higher it looks like you gain some pretty good lieback slopers.  Your fallzone is a narrow chasm, so bring lots of big pads...Mondos and Triple Folds.

If you walk down into the chasm and look up, you'll recognize the view from the video.  I have a couple of better pics for this problem as well, I'll post them tomorrow~

They were trying the same moves as has been tried. I think it will go as a big dyno once you bring your left hand up to match. RTM, do you know if the line can be bouldered without bringing in the law?

Yeah, that's possible.  So for me that would mean:  1) adding ratings to photos, and then 2) showing these photos on the homepage.  

What should I do until we get some ratings in place?  Just randomly show pics until the ratings start sorting them out?  

What kind of ratings system should we use for photos?  1-5 stars?  Or something simpler like &quot;like it / love it&quot;  (I think I'd prefer this).  Thoughts?

Any ideas where this slideshow should go on the front page?  It already feels crammed to me.  Maybe replace the &quot;welcome&quot; and &quot;total problems&quot; area?

Pumping is at Cap Rock.  Follow Park Blvd past Intersection Rock.  Turn Right at the paved road heading toward Keys Point.  Cap Rock will be the conglomerations immediately on the left hand side.  Parking lot is on the left.

There are two major conglomerations, one on your left and one on your right.  Follow the obvious trail from the parking lot (starting next to the outhouse) toward the conglomeration on the right, staying on the left fork as it leads you left and around. Keep looking straight ahead along the trail and you'll see the problem boulder (more distinctly the trail passes between two very large, close together boulders; the one on the left is the problem boulder). Another tell-tale sign for the problem boulder is that upon walking up to it via these directions, if you look up near the obvious lip of the boulder from the trail, you should see a couple of shallow huecos with chalk on them, low enough to jump to.  I forget which problem that is, some V5-V6 thing.  Pumping Monzonite is on the opposite arete, starting on the huge thread near the bottom.  Go get it Aztec!

It's been done with a few different sequences. Play on it and figure out move by move what works best for you. 

If I remember right, Bittersweet does start one the two really thin crimps. The thing to the right Rob Mulligan did and I can't remember what he called it. I think it was v7ish, but not sure.

Eliminates  - deliberately not using certain holds, usually the big jugs, etc. - almost always harder.
Sit Down Starts (SDS) speak for themselves - almost always harder.
Variations - different start or different finish - can be easier or harder.

Naming conventions:
Legitimate with a different name, but can also be called the same name as the original route with Eliminate, SDS or Var. tagged on the end.

New problems or not? This is tricky. Not a new problem if they were spawned from the original problem, but rather a new eliminate, new SDS, or new variation to the original problem. 
However, if a problem has a completely different start and/or finish, but only uses one or two holds of the original boulder problem, I'd say it could legitimately be called a separate (new) problem. Perhaps also if it's significantly different in concept.";"1e700f2662f73472b7359dc4382f8b18";"0";;"33bdnubd";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

If people are putting up new problems in either location, post them up on the database or if some problems are in question, post up the issue here and we'll talk about it. Hopefully this will give the authors of these books a pool of information they can pull from and make it easier on them if there is new stuff they are unaware of.

Also, if you have any thoughts or comments on the workings of the guidebooks (icons used, directions, limitations, good things used in other books, etc) post them up as well. This isn't meant to slander the authors (we know rTm has done a sweet job with his other books and I'm sure Ian and Alan's Black Mt. guide will be fantastic as well) but again just a source of information they can pull from that reflects the climbing community's thoughts on guidebooks in general. Everyone has their two cents, now's your chance to show those pretty pennies. 

To the authors, I'm trying to make your lives easier, or at least just this once.  <!-- s:mrgreen: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_mrgreen.gif\" alt=\":mrgreen:\" title=\"Mr. Green\" /><!-- s:mrgreen: -->";"2e73219c4634a97daa38a48143bf3f45";"0";;"1dso7eli";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

If HVCG fills up, you can try Ryan Campground next, then Jumbo, then drive out to Belle if the others are full.  Worse case, there's some BLM land out of the park, but it's hard to find unless someone shows you.  When traveling alone or with one other person, I've *never* had to stay outside of the park, though I've done my fair share of begging to share someone's site.  <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->";"caad910c80f5f8bb81151bf88fb0ea08";"0";;"2pwfqqmr";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

Alright so my recent 'discussion' with stretch about the Yabo Roof Traverse.  He believes sharp jugs and a 10 foot traverse 5 feet off the ground equate to one star.  Completely his opinion based on what he perceives rock quality to be as well as quality of movement. For me, completely different opinion.  Quality of movement was almost equal to that of White Rastafarian, except much more technical.  The jugs were sharp but felt perfectly fine to me.  Technical sequence into a rather perfect mantle (not hard but no gimme either).  For me this was [i:2epi000i]at least[/i:2epi000i] a 3 out of 5-star problem.

So in the end, it's consensus opinion on quality.  But even that can be so subjective based on the climber's physical aspects or possibly in the above case, different envisioned/executed sequence of movement.

I would LOVE to see a bio for some of the older, classic lines in JTree though (I didn't see it addressed in the thread but rTm, consider this my request for it PLEASE!).  Not that the brief history's given in the JTree and Tram guides were bad.  I just would have liked to know more about some of the individual contributors. and more of the history in-depth.   I love the bios and history included in the Bishop guide.  Being able to read about Bishop's history, who's treaded though there, who's put up what lines, etc., it allows the reader/climber to attain a deeper appreciation for what the place has to offer. Brief bio's on some of JTree's desert rats (especially Long, Hill and the late and great Bachar) would be sweet.

I'm sure nsmonkeygirl that you've already bought a crashpad. Anyways, there are basically only a few types of pad out there. The dominant style is an open cell foam pad, top layer approx. 1 inch closed cell foam, with primarily shoulder straps. This type of pad can not carry too much since the load is on the shoulders. Regarding the foam, the heavier it is, the better it is. That's a bit generalized, but is mostly true. I use a flashed pad (I'm also biased in that I'm one of their product testers), a shogun, and the foam has been seriously used for maybe 5 or more years, and I've had them replace the cover once, last month, and the top closed cell layer some time early last year, I think. The open cell foam used by flashed is one of the heavier if not the heaviest out there, but it's also basically bombproof. It's in perfect condition to this day. All closed cell breaks down, and it's supposed to do that. It takes the brunt of the shock on impact and needs to be replaced on occasion. The outer cover was still usable, but flashed replaced mine to test the addition of top supports that pull the upper part close to my back and shoulders.  

Of the two types of conventional pads, the heavier ones with better open cell foam need more support for carrying them. The flashed conventional pads are the only ones that I know of with a real or serious hip harness. The lighter you are and the less capable your shoulders are for taking the weight of pad and gear, a hip system makes a huge difference. All their pads with full hip support ride very well. I can easily hike for 2 hours one way, seriously, without any issues and carrying a full day's load of water, camera stuff, food and gear. 

the other type of pad is an air pad system, and I only know of flashed air pad that's in production, but I'm sure someone might fill me in on others. It's quite different in characteristics and is heavier than other pads. The primary strength of the air pad is that it absorbs almost all the kinetic energy on impact. What this means is that you don't get that rebound shock from the open cell foam trying to return to it's original form. For most peeps (younger mainly) it's no big deal to deal with, but in the long run, there is the possibility that the conventional pads could cause knee and lower back issues. Of course this is premised on the fact that one is actually falling from a decent height repeatedly. Also, the edges on the air pad don't hold up to a fixed corner or edge, so it's very forgiving if you land on the edge. the downside is it because it doesn't hold up, pushed up against a conventional pad will expose the conventional pad's edge. The higher you fall, the better the air pad is, IMHO. The air pad also doesn't hold a rigid base or form against irregular surfaces. This can be both good and bad. The good is that it'll conform and deform on impact when the surface is angled--meaning it acts as if the surface is flat. A conventional pad will literally &quot;kick&quot; you off and down the slope of the pad. The bad is that the air will not establish a rigid and flat surface over irregularities. Sharp objects will cause the pad to not be as effective and will potentially create a risk of impact if not fixed by other means (mainly to use a conventional pad to flatten the area first). The air pad is expensive. The latest design of the airpad now rides very good. It has the upper straps to pull the top close, and it uses the full suspension. 

After using the air pad, I feel it's the best there is. It has limitations, that should improve with better technology and design. What makes it so good has everything to do with the impact feel. I typically take one air pad and one conventional pad. Because it's expensive, I think it's best suited for those wanting to do highballs. because the edges are forgiving, it's perfect as the top layer and strike zone sitting over conventional pads. 

A buddy of mine recently had his lower spine fuzed, after twice rupturing a disc. He loves highballs and he's not afraid to go for it. It cost him. He uses the air pad now and swears by it. No one can say what the causes are for his back problem, but I really do think, anecdotally, that had he had an air pad the whole time, he wouldn't have a fuzed spine today. just my opinion. of course, how one falls has tons to do with impact as well as one's genes, I'm sure. 

I assume by your name that you're a chick, if so, the temple works very well and isn't a small pad. I've had several women say it's their best crash pad and they love the way it carries. Their small and their shoulders took a beating with the conventional designs sans serious waist strap.

I'm rather psyched to see this black mountain guide and I'm keeping very positive thoughts about it, mainly because, in all honesty, I can't stand black mountain!  Long-ass drive, then seemingly endless winding road, just to hit more winding dirt road, all to get to climbing areas that I either need to hike to, or are in the sun for the majority of the day.  either that or it's just gloomy and depressing!

Highballs get'em I think because they potentially bring into play a mental crux.  If the crux of White Rastafarian were only 5 feet off the ground, it wouldn't be that fun or exciting.  But with that stupid-ass boulder in the fall zone and a crux roughly 15 feet up, there's a little bit more to think through, especially if you're scared of heights.  So yeah if you enjoy dealing with a mental crux due to height or bad landing areas (or both in this case), then there's definitely going to be a higher degree of satisfaction upon sending, and within that, enjoyment.

Personally, I like jacked up landing zones too.  They can put just as much of a fear factor into play as being super high off the ground.  With that, I would also put that into consideration for quality.  For example, the landing zone for Illuminatrix at the Tram...two words came to mind when we first saw it...&quot;Fuck That&quot;. haha  only a V4 but still would be a proud send for those who like the thrill of serious injury or potential death.  Oh and don't forget Up 40 in JTree; 30+ feet high, X-Rated landing~  I see it as a noteworthy achievement for anyone who can master their fears enough to send wicked problems like that.

I too have done a fair amount of enjoyable problems that get one or zero stars in any number of guidebooks.  I think it has to do with history too.  Obviously the history behind many classic problems is just as star worthy as the actual enjoyment level.  

Another thing too, ratings change with my mood.  (whoa, now I sound like a woman)  But as I recall, I did Yabo Roof Traverse with only my non-climbing (at the moment) girlfriend watching, on a cold winter day with no warmth and even less motivation.  I've done my fair amount of zero star climbing on a beautiful sunny day, absent from the stress of work/school, with good people surrounding me, that I swear were 4 or 5 star classics!  It's all about vibe.  

As for the sissy hands...yeah I guess that's me.

When it comes down to it, a guide needs to tell you three things about a problem: If you can do it, if you want to do it, where it is. A rating answers the first question, stars are for the second, and directions/descriptions are for the third. We can only climb so hard and we only only have so much time to climb, so ratings and stars are really where it's at. Imagine going to Bishop and not even visiting the Buttermilks because the guide didn't tell you they were awesome. Or going to Font and skipping Bas Cuvier. Or spending a Yosemite trip exclusively on the glacier point apron, simply out of negligence. Just as certain areas are better than others, certain climbs are better than others. Sometimes it is pretty subjective, but most people agree most of the time. Stem Gem is a great problem, the choss behind it sucks. The right side of the Gallery at Red Rocks is super fun, but the left side is short, punky, and miserable. 

There is room for reasonable disagreement with stars, just as there is room for reasonable disagreement with the grade. People can have different reasonable thoughts as to whether a problem is v4 or v5, whether a problem is ** or ***. But it is rare that one person says a problem is v4 and another v10. Same for stars. Truly horrible problems are universally acknowledged as such, as are the very best. When it comes down to it, this is what really matters, and stars convey this information efficiently and clearly.

Over time, I find that it's useless. I just look at the little pictures and then try and judge for myself. 

There needs to be a balance and there needs, I think, to be an explanation of the author's definition or an explanation of where he/she is coming from and prioritizing. I think with sufficient additional content, icons or such, and an explanation, more would be in agreement with ratings and appreciative of taking the time to steer climbers towards what they want to climb or try. In the end, isn't the guide for the guided? 

my two cents... 

btw, I feel the rating is a start and only that, but type of climbing, holds, steepness, and fall zone, and other information, together, will tell you if you can do it. Stars, if reliable tell you the authors' interests (readers aren't sheep and have their own opinions), but regarding the location I agree totally with you.

Seriously, it sounds like you are the one that doesn't like dissent... but I digress. 

I personally find the guidebooks that give plenty of extra information on the problems tend to have star ratings more to my liking. And when I don't find the star ratings useful, I do hope they've taken advantage of modern technology and used photos to identify the problems. 

&quot;What does a guidebook author know about the problems in her book that you can't get out of a photo of the problems anyway?&quot; 

Well, if I have to rely on stars alone, I would have to say nothing else. And since I can't mind meld with this fictitious woman, I guess her knowledge is hers to enjoy, but offering it up as information is certainly more helpful then just a personalized star system.

When I visit an area that I am unfamiliar with, I find quality ratings to be useful. Not that I disregard low/no star climbs, but in hopes of seeing/climbing on the better of what an area has to offer, I do use stars to help me plan my limited time. Once at a location though, I visually inspect the climbs for myself and climb whatever looks good. 

I find that, for the most part, I do agree with star ratings in most guides, maybe about 75% of the time. Enough to trust them. 

One would hope that guide authors use consensus opinions to 'star' climbs, although, given human nature, its prolly reasonable to assume that any given author will give more weight to their own opinion.

I personally think you should set holds filling the wall with actual intended problems and then with that many holds on you can make up more stuff.  This is probably more effort but seems like you would have problems that flow/serve an intended purpose more, no?  

When I had a home wall I preferred setting a limited number of problems, always leaving a few holds off the wall for the next session and just stripping a few periodically.

Good call.  I guess it'd be a total pain in the ass to keep pads dry (and bolted down during windy seasons).  Garage may be a better answer.

This would be my first trip to the tram boulders, and I know theres going to be a good amount of snow up there. I was hoping to pick up the 'tram bouldering' guidebook, but i can't find it anywhere online. amazon is soldout, ebay is no help. i've been to rei and sportchalet with no luck, also barnes&amp;noble....

I plan to drive to palm springs sunday night when I get off work, crash for a few hours, wake up, and take the first tram to the top. I'm bringing my backpacking gear and lots of layers. The plan is to set up a base camp at an ideal site, (any suggestions on the good sites?) and then venture out from there and explore/boulder. We will be camping monday night, leaving tuesday afternoon.

Has anyone created a handy googlemaps/earth image with some of the good boulders pinpointed? 
What are some tips I'll need to know about the area?
Will i be ok just exploring and finding shit to climb or will i need a guidebook for sure?

Keep in mind the problems we will be climbing will more than likely be no higher than a v4. lots of v0's and v1's would be ideal. our goal is just to chill, climb, relax, and have fun.

any help is appreciated, thanks";"66d4e89a3dd7e6685de73591cc6f4ce7";"0";;"36klyre7";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

Unless someone says otherwise, I'd presume the Tram is buried under snow right now and not very climbable.  Sorry, man.

For winter climbing, your best bet will be Joshua Tree.  The Tram (and Black Mtn.) season usually doesn't start rolling until late March/early April.

If you can't find the Tram guide online, you can check Nomad Ventures or check with the publisher:

I played a similar game-too my girlfriend up there two weekends ago just to hike in the snow.  ALL of the boulders are buried.  She and I screwed around on one boulder, but it was only do-able in hiking boots.  Also due to the snow level none of the climbs are discernible.  I've been up there a lot and while I could vaguely tell where I was by the valleys, there is no way to find the climbs.  Keep in mind, this was all two weeks ago a few days after the storm.  I can only imagine conditions have only gotten worse.  

I'm with the others.  I highly suggest JTree-Hidden Valley Campground to be specific.  Since you're going up on a Sunday or Monday morning you shouldn't have much if any trouble finding a campsite.  Most of the campsites have fire pits which is a definite win.  You don't need a reservation for the site which will make life easier with the short notice.  And of course the desert night sky is always a winner for a trip with the girl.  As far as the climbing, pick up a copy of A Complete Bouldering Guidebook to Joshua Tree National Park by Robert Miramontes.  There is ample beginner to mid-range bouldering right in camp and an abundant amount of un-established rock for just walking around and jumping on stuff.

V0-V4 at Josh does not equal V0-V4 in the gym.  At all.
I think The Outback, Manx, Meadows Boulder, and Ryan are all full of fun stuff for getting acquainted with Josh, just be prepared for sandbags, weird funky climbing, mantels of death, and bloody hands.  Having said that, Josh is so much fun, and so alien, you've gotta do it. Cold at night though, just a heads up.

if her idea of a great time is postholing thru 4 feet of snow so she can climb on the top 2 feet of a dripping wet boulder, then you must go to tram! why go to boring old jtree, where all the factors are know? go for tha X factor man! tram! you might even get to be eaten by a mountain lion, or watch your gal be consumed while you throw rocks!!!

As far as what is actually the Eppulator I'm not 100% sure but I believe it's the short steep face on the left side of the road before Don't Rock the Boat at Woodson.

Pretty sure there is a nominal fee for camping, but the site's are nice and it won't break the bank.  Ton's of bouldering in and around the campground as well as all over the mountain.  Many great easy problems and moderates.  Really cool sandstone, and probably one of the best and most overlooked bouldering areas in So Cal.  As for guides pickup Bob Bank's &quot;Oceans Eleven&quot;.  It covers Pine Mountain as well as the Santa Barbara areas, and the now defunct Swimming Hole.

Well, for one I bouldered on that very same boulder in the late 80's and funny thing - at that time there happened to be chalk on it. I asked around and found that that boulder as well as numerous others in the vicinity were climbed back in the early to mid 1980's. You have to remember that bouldering has been going on out there for 30+ years if not more.

It's foolish to assume that just because a boulder or boulder problem isn't in the guidebook means it hasn't been done, especially something right off the road and super obvious, and a problem having no chalk on it means absolutely nothing.  

Cool that you're getting out there and exploring beyond what's in the guidebook because it's literally the tip of the iceberg. If you want some ideas on other areas to check out let me know.";"6ddd0893d4972b68b42c89ab0cac619c";"0";"gA==";"2aj5o9pe";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

It IS J-tree and I should have assumed EVERYTHING here has been climbed, the only thing that threw me off is that the hold around the left side of the arete broke several times on me and is now about 1/4 of the size it was when I first attempted it.  I would hate to leave this problem unnamed (I personally think unnamed climbs should be limited to the trash that is scattered around the actually fun problems) so if an original name cannot be remembered I would suggest &quot;reacharound&quot; due to the super balancy fun move where you need to reach with your right hand around the left side of the arete to grab the crimp.

I believe there are a number of folks who would agree you.  I personally would rather there be a name for a problem that's enjoyable because unnamed problems tend to have this stigma of sucking (you yourself even elude to this in your posting) when they actually may not suck at all (i.e. what you enjoy may be completely different from what someone else enjoys).

But when a name is unknown and the problem has been done before, it's better to leave history as-is. Besides, JTree is almost infinite when it comes to undiscovered boulders and problems and if you're willing to wander the desert a bit, you'll be sure to find something that needs an FA. Though I've been pretty far out there at times only to find chalk even in the most remote areas.

Some other indicators that a problem has been climbed before are completely clean/flat landing areas or flattened/mangled plants at or around the base of a boulder.  Breakage (or choss/grain/kitty litter) is natural due erosion. Consider that this boulder probably hasn't seen much traffic and is for the most part exposed (weather having a bigger impact on it; rain washing away chalk for example); It isn't surprising that a hold or two may have eroded over a long period of time, just waiting to be broken off.  

The oldschoolers are an almost endless well of info on JTree, so if in doubt or want confirmation, get feedback from them.

I'll be in LA in May and I'd like to have a 2 days bouldering on the week-end of the 22nd-23rd, and I do have a bunch of questions...

I am a little bit hesitating between Bishop (too hot?), the Tram and Black Mountain... What's your feeling between Tram and BM? Do I have a chance to meet some climbers at that time? Do you know if I can rent a pad somewhere (I'd prefer not to bring mine overseas for 2 days bouldering...)? Where can I find a the Black Mountain guidebook (even DrTopo's one)? Is the Tram guidebook up to date?

Thanks in advance for answering the questions you can ;o)

I can tell you that the tram guide came out a couple years ago, but is pretty current. I hear there's a lot of snow still up there but you can get to the boulders. 

Black Mt has some interesting restraints right now. The loggers up there have all the gates closed down to the paved road but they may not be there around your time frame. The newer area called the &quot;the Republic&quot; is accessible and has no gates but you will want a high clearance vehicle to get up the dirt road and you can camp up there. There is no real guidebook for the area yet but one is currently underway. The author and myself will most likely be up there on the 23rd. A huge climbing gym we work at is opening on the 22nd and we'll have to be there for that unfortunately. 

I've also heard Bishop is heating up. I'd say your best bet is a day at tram and a day at Black. Stay current on the forum and you should find some peeps to climb/tour you around with that weekend.";"3acd66ea73bfd7e7ccc453057d132c61";"0";;"28rkbisw";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

I think my plan will be : one day at the Tram, on day at BM, and the 3rd morning to finish the best project I'd have tried the days before. That does sound great!
The gates you're talking about, are they closed because of the snow or what? Why may they be opened when I'm there?

If someone could please chime in on the name of these problems and their grade so we can get them onto the db, that would be great.

This first one is the V5 Unamed mantle problem up the hill from the O.K. Problem. I guess the stand start is considered V3 and the sit is supposed to be V5?  Can anyone confirm that besides Hien?  <!-- sjoe1 --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/biggrinjester[1].gif\" alt=\"joe1\" title=\"wiseguy\" /><!-- sjoe1 -->

Next one is near Fallen Arch (?), about 30-40 yards behind Transmaniacon at the Basin Campground.  Both felt maybe V1/V2:
[img:vzrw5gi7]http&#58;//i166&#46;photobucket&#46;com/albums/u118/herbiackwings/Unnamed001&#46;jpg[/img:vzrw5gi7]

This one is a VB/V0 arete on the same boulder as Transmaniacon:

Next one is at the group campgrounds.  If you're facing Soulsnatch, this is to the left about 15 yards.  The one on the left is roughly V0, the middle one was said to be V5 (Aron).  BTW, is there an area name for the group campgrounds or do we just refer to it as the Group Campground?:

Lastly, this is on the Morphic Resonance boulder at the Corral, to the right of Morphic Resonance.  The Unamed V3 highball and the V6 traverse into the highball (Aron):

Also, there's a small boulder with a low roof  (approx 5 feet high) that's NW of Franks Roof up the hill right over the fallen down tree that's not in the guide. Anyone seen this? I tried it last season and saw some chalk on it so I'm in no way stating an FA.  Squat start on the low brick on the right then top out in the center with a heinous mantle. If you haven't seen it, it's a fun challenge!

IMO it's gotta be either a different start, different finish, different path or a combination.  Inclusion/Exclusion of holds doesn't count unless you're adding length to the problem (ex. Desperanza at Hueco...though that's also an example of 'different start').

In addition to that, there is an unknown problem to the very right of the boulder that starts on two incut crimps and deadpoints to a sloper, roughly V4/V5 FA D. Corso.

Group Campground never had a name.  It wasn't a Group Campground (didn't have a numbered site until 1990 or so.)  And none of those problems had names that I ever heard or used.  V5 is probably about right for the hardest of the routes on that little flat face with the nice edges.

The Boulder Basin campground thing, with the easy edge and the short slabby face, had two fairly difficult mantles (i.e., harder than boneheads, easier than fallen arch) on it.  No common names.    The bigger boulder with the long, bucketed arete and all the other problems never had names attached to it either, that I can recall.

The Hueco Problem was always just called the &quot;Hueco Problem,&quot; by us.  I don't know if had an older name.  The top of that boulder had a hangerless, 1/4&quot; stud that was already old and rusty the first time I saw it (1982 or 3).  Largo didn't place any bolts up there, so far as I know.  So who knows when those things first got done.  

&quot;Morphic Resonance&quot; used to have a bucket flake at the start.

Ok...even mentioning the possibility that this might be OK in Joshua Tree is just plain sacrilege.  Comfortising == Chipping.  You're basically altering holds through means other than the natural wear-and-tear of Mother Nature or years of climbing traffic.  

If it's too sharp for you, just don't climb it or tape up.  I've had problems cut my finger tips before; I just taped up and went at it again.

Whether you &quot;crank&quot; V4? or crank V14, it doesn't matter. It's not OK. If you're gonna clean off new problems, use a normal brush; a hard-bristled cleaning brush at most.  And no metallic brushes either as have the same effect as files.

Since I started going to tram I have seen climber impact on the mountain.  Go to any climbing area and you will see used tape, spilled chalk, smashed plants and braided trails.  It may be true that the non-climbers there have a greater impact on the park (possibly because there are significantly more of them) but you will typically find that they don't tend to wander far off trail or far from the station.  We as climbers tend to visit more remote areas and wander off trail whenever we go.  I can't tell you how many different &quot;braids&quot; of trail I have seen when there is already an obvious trail heading out to certain areas.  

It will of course be easier for rangers to target boulderers because we are an actual group that can be targeted, unlike tourists.  Tourists come maybe twice in a year (or in a lifetime) so having a chat with them is pretty pointless.  

Regardless of politics, egos and attitudes the rangers are there to protect the park.  It is their job and we must understand that.  In my opinion, it is our responsibility to work with the rangers to ensure the park stays clean with as little an impact as possible.  It isn't OUR mountain, its natures and we need to respect that (this is the reason the entire park system was set up).  I have a feeling a lot of the &quot;problem&quot; boulderers are tram virgins or go very rarely (which would definitely explain the trail braiding).  Maybe posting a sign specifically for boulderers in the station or at the permit location that lists some climbing etiquette rules may make the rangers feel a little better about us.  Remember, you catch more bees with honey than a big ole pile of stinkin' shit; which, make sure you bury atleast 6 inches down  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D --> .";"f71629bf9fba88ea1c24f74a783631f3";"0";;"1bu91ufi";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

New problems include: much larger posse's bringing many more pads, an increase of chalk use and tick marks, louder groups with less of a concern for the wilderness (probably due to a change in the demograph of boulderers). 

There are also several disturbing and totally unacceptable new trends that I have not seen before this year: one is the building of platforms on sloping landings, and the other is debris stripping an entire area beneath a boulder problem (I'm talking every twig and pebble, leaving a barren patch of dirt). 


The main difference now at Tram, is that we have a new Park Service staff, seeing the problems with fresh eyes and having the will to make change. Whether we like it or not, this change is inevitable. 


Even if we win this round and things stay the same, current bouldering habits are leading us down a road that will ultimately end in severe restrictions, not only at Tram, but across the entire country. The bouldering community need to open its eyes and change its ways ...quickly! Make no mistake, wilderness authorities and the National Park Service is amassing data, they have been for years now. Cold, hard and indesputable data that will be used to create a policy that preserves the wilderness and curbs bouldering impact. If any of you think we can preserve our freedoms with nothing more than witty comments and uncompromising attitudes, then you are sadly mistaken.";"4af51c46cbbc3d0bffc6784b20fb1f56";"0";;"6h2mbqy2";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

On the otherhand, Purple stones are superb (and are not on the coast but in a lush canyon)

As said before, the pebble is often not reachable due to tide and is of lower quality rock than that found in topanga, though it is of the same formation.

The park is full of rock but not much of it is solid enough for climbing - this is not a destination area and not worth a long trip unless you are in the bay area and have already been to castle rock, berkeley, mickeys/stinson, vacaville/putah and the sonoma coast and still want something new. if you are in the santa rosa area it is the best nearby bouldering spot with a good concentration of moderate level problems on small to medium sized boulders mostly off of good trails in lush redwood forests! c u there with other locals on friday afternoons 420 ish <!-- s;) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s;) -->

everything else is pretty much through the talus field and lower than meadow roof. 

If you are heading up the the trail, you cross a double log bridge over the stream. Continue up this trail till it wraps around to the right while keeping an eye to the left for a faint trail. Take this faint trail till it hits the talus field. Here you should find Crimp Ladder, Wave Catcher, and Knife Dance. The larger boulder(s) above this have Paralyzed, Who's retarded now, i'm too drunk to taste this chicken and a few others. Up and to the right in the woods will be Will's Seam. More climbs are higher up in the talus field between this and the meadow.

Watch that video, the first couple of problems I was shown but I have a feeling JTree veterans have known about them for years.

The first one...if you're facing the Nicole Overhang, it's at your 2 o'clock, about 20 yards or so away, tucked inside, between a few boulders.  Steep problem, good holds, looks fun.  Just around to the left (if you're facing this problem) there's a wall against the small conglomeration that has 3 more problems, one of which is 2nd problem shown in the video.  Also, how do I know it's the Planet X area...in the vid you'll catch a short glimpse of Newton's Law.  <!-- sjoe1 --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/biggrinjester[1].gif\" alt=\"joe1\" title=\"wiseguy\" /><!-- sjoe1 -->

Some friends and myself have started a little climbing group in Hemet, CA, spending most of our time in James Simpson Park and a couple of trips to JTree.  Jack Mcbroom has showed us the ropes up there and now I would like to step up and digitize the information we have logged from Simpson Park; and this site seems like the perfect place to start!  
     So I just wanted to stop by, say hi, and let you know that a community of climbers are growing in Hemet.  We are calling ourselves &quot;Team Limestoned&quot;  and you can catch us a group on Facebook, we have some videos on YouTube, and a website should be coming soon!  Hit us up if you are ever in the area, we enjoy the company and learning from others!

A bunch of my friends and I are considering a road trip to California from Ottawa, Canada.

Our plan is to drive to the southern part, probably starting in San Diego, and work our way up, all the way up the coast to our final destination which would be British Columbia, Canada.

As we make our way, we want to do some bouldering and would like to know some really good areas to do so.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->     <!-- s8) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\" /><!-- s8) -->    <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->

The thing about climbing on sandstone after rains is that you may not think you're damaging the rock, especially on large hold problems, but it applies stress to the structure of the rock and can cause it to be much more brittle, drastically decreasing the lifespan of a hold.

 Other than that, Planet of the Apes Wall in Malibu tends to stay dryer and dry out faster than other areas in the park.

Horse Flats is made of Granite so should be A-Ok, it takes about an hour from LA and you my have to walk a mile in if the gates closed though- I don't think it has too much if any snow this year.

How does Wasabi finish?";"After the opening moves, there are a few longish moves to crisp crimps running pretty much vertically up and left from the start. The problem traverses left at the top.

You can also bump up the difficulty (much harder) by starting further right and traversing into the problem.  To my knowledge, this has not been climbed yet.

There's also a short problem to the right of Wasabi that I was trying, but wasn't able to control the hold after the big move.  This line pretty much revolves around a big move to the obvious large edge, before topping out up and right on the lower summit.  It's a shorter line, but equally good.

Good luck, and let us know if you end up adding anything good out there...

It's far easier if you have a car. Park near the top of Bienvenida Ave. in Pacific Palisades and walk in via the Leacock Trail to the Bienvenida Trail to the Temescal Ridge Trail, turning left each time you can. 

If you don't have a car, take the bus to the Temescal Canyon stop and walk in via the Temescal Ridge Trail. The first way is about 1.2 miles with a fair amount of uphill. The second is about 2.5 miles with a good deal more uphill.

The most obvious boulder is right on the trail. there are a few good problems on the back side in the V0 - V2 range, including a fun little problem with sweet mono (not sure of name or grade - feels V2ish). There is potential for harder stuff, but the landings are not great. 

The other boulders are in the scrub downhill from the trail. Again, there is enough to keep somebody busy for a while, but the uphill hike to access the boulders and the thick brush are obstacles. The bouldering is all on relatively solid sandstone. Don't bother after rain as the rock gets very saturated and weak and you'll end up breaking holds.";"40f7c768bee8ad589df5de421def38e4";"0";;"37m6s8ev";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

I asked around and found out a guy that had been climbing in the Ice Cave earlier that day had picked it up, asked around about it, thought it might belong to someone from his group and took it to find out.  He was a strong V11, V12 climber.  He was down there to try Beefy Gecko.  I came down to try Wheel of Beef, he suggested I try The Aquarium.  One guy in his crew tried The Aquatic Hitchhiker, it looked cool, so I tried it, and he ended up on it too.  He looked to be of Mexican or South American decent.  He had very dark brown skin, medium-long bushy brown hair, fairly ripped but not bulky body, and was wearing lime green shorts.  I overheard him saying he had been staying at The Trees motel for a week but had checked out that Saturday morning.  It was also suggested to me that he was from the Bay Area.  

I posted Lost posters at Wilson's and Black Sheep.

A lot of loose comparisons can be made, but things are so subjective when you're looking at the difficulty of single moves and short sequences (such as found on boulder problems and for which the V-scale exists) when compared to the longer strings of moves and sequences that make up route climbing (and the YDS system).  In fact your &quot;15c doesn't exist, so V16 can't equal it&quot; doesn't really hold true in that someone could argue that the individual difficult moves found on a V16 could in fact result in a 15c route if that sequence was interspersed with moderately easier climbing in a route context.

Also, V0 traditionally meant 5.10+ or 5.10d.  Over the years, some ratings comparisons have morphed into (I feel) easier scale comparisons, but if you want to go with how the system was originally designed - that should be your starting point.

I also feel that a lot of gym grades have become soft when compared to the traditional sense of the V-scale.  Because of this pattern in gyms, I feel you'll start (and probably already have) seeing things get a little softer on the bottom end of the V-scale outside as more gym climbers boulder outdoors.  There are some who will (and have already) argue(d) that this is happening on the upper end of the scale too.  I can't really comment on that though.

Again, my opinion is only one of many you'll probably receive, and to some extent I'm just playing devil's advocate here...";"e8a11e3f4b6edcbb04d293a095dc6ad9";"0";;"3tswgwpi";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

I'm trying to do some better comparisons, so here's the list I've got.  

A few markers:
* I think a v0 is 5.10a
* I think v4 is 5.12a
* I was told by a v12 climber that he thinks v10 is 5.14a
* 8a.nu says v11 = 8a = 5.13b.  However, they also say v3 = 6a = 5.10a  ...wha?

Thoughts?

Luckily, she herself has a climbing background and understood our viewpoints on the whole situation! I’m sure I speak for all of us when I say we appreciated her open-mindedness and understanding in what we had to say, just as much as she appreciated our efforts and enthusiasm during the cleanup! <!-- s:mrgreen: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_mrgreen.gif\" alt=\":mrgreen:\" title=\"Mr. Green\" /><!-- s:mrgreen: --> 

Now let’s re-review Ranger Sue’s major concerns, all of which we will proactively address this coming season.  As a funny and ironic side note, all these concerns are already listed in rTm’s “Tram Bouldering” guide, pg 6-7.  And to think we had the information all along and most likely just overlooked it!  <!-- s:confused: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/headscratch[1].gif\" alt=\":confused:\" title=\"confused\" /><!-- s:confused: -->  <!-- s:hammer; --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/all_coholic[1].gif\" alt=\":hammer;\" title=\"party animal\" /><!-- s:hammer; --> 

[list:bkyqaxlk][b:bkyqaxlk]1.  Pack out all trash and garbage.[/b:bkyqaxlk]  Can’t tell you guys/gals how many cigarette butts, used tape wads, bottle caps, water bottles, used toilet paper strips, wrappers, etc. etc. I was able to find last summer.  URG!  Please remember to pack out ALL of it.
[b:bkyqaxlk]2.  Have no more than 15 people in your group and hike apart from other groups.[/b:bkyqaxlk]  Last year saw some major traffic and with it, unmarked trails saw some extra traffic, popular areas saw a bit more trash, a bit more chalk, and it definitely got a little loud!  Following along with James March’s suggestions, maybe we can try to keep the groups smaller this year, keep the big pads at home and only use the midsized ones, maybe even do a solo trip now and again?  I’ll leave that up to you guys to figure out yourselves but let’s try to keep it in mind.
[b:bkyqaxlk]3.  Erect no structures made from rocks, branches or other natural materials.  This includes small rock cairns.[/b:bkyqaxlk]  Last year the Titanic Boulder (Year of the Cockroach &amp; Love of Basic Cable) had a rather huge platform built underneath it.  I’ll have to give props to the two guys who built it as it must have taken them at least half the day, and it definitely mitigated the risk level of the fall zone.  However this was a big NO-NO and had to get torn down.  Sorry guys, State Park rules...
[b:bkyqaxlk]4.  No smoking.[/b:bkyqaxlk]  You know how many cigarette butts I cleaned up at the Dance Floor last summer alone? One too many!!!  State Park rules guys…no smoking on the mountain.  If you gotta smoke, please get your fix at the parking lot before you head up.
[b:bkyqaxlk]5.  No person shall appear nude.[/b:bkyqaxlk] .........  <!-- s:confused: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/headscratch[1].gif\" alt=\":confused:\" title=\"confused\" /><!-- s:confused: -->  <!-- s:potent: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/tdo13[1].gif\" alt=\":potent:\" title=\"potent\" /><!-- s:potent: -->  <!-- s:heshian: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/lhdevil[1].gif\" alt=\":heshian:\" title=\"hedbang2\" /><!-- s:heshian: --> 
[b:bkyqaxlk]6.  No person shall pick, molest, disturb or burn any plant materials (alive or dead).[/b:bkyqaxlk]  I hope this season we do our best to stay on the main trails.  Though the majority of the climbing areas have well established trails, we are still observing several braids through some of the high traffic areas.  Let’s remember to move from area to area in a single-file line, following established trails only, allowing some of those unnecessary braids an entire summer season to revegetate.  
[/list:u:bkyqaxlk]

Also, as rTm mentioned in a previous forum topic, other concerns were abuse of chalk, loud music and yelling.

[list:bkyqaxlk][b:bkyqaxlk]Abuse of Chalk - [/b:bkyqaxlk]The chalk is simply part of climbing, plain and simple.  We can however do our best to brush off as much excessive chalk as possible.  Additionally, if we utilize tic marks, we must always remember to brush them off after we’re done.  Easy enough yea?  And if you spill your bag/bucket, please remember to recoup as much of it as possible and bury the rest.
[b:bkyqaxlk]Loud Music - [/b:bkyqaxlk]I’ve frequented the Tram solo many a time, not seeing a single soul from the moment I left the Ranger Station until the time I got back.  The silence is indescribably peaceful, with only the slightest breeze serving as the single intruder to my solitude. To hear thumping-a$$ hip-hop beats or Cannibal Corpse blaring in the distance can be rather annoying.  If you need music to motivate you, please keep the volume low enough for yourself and/or your group.  Better yet, consider busting out your iPod!  On solo trips I always bust out the Shuffle vs. the portable speakers when I need that dose of Motorhead to get the send!  <!-- s:heshian: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/lhdevil[1].gif\" alt=\":heshian:\" title=\"hedbang2\" /><!-- s:heshian: --> 
[b:bkyqaxlk]Yelling - [/b:bkyqaxlk]Being psyched about that project you just sent is something all of us can get behind.  However I witnessed some seriously excessive cussing and yelling last season (I won’t say who or what LA-based gym they’re coming from <!-- sjoe1 --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/biggrinjester[1].gif\" alt=\"joe1\" title=\"wiseguy\" /><!-- sjoe1 -->). There’s no need to run off and around the place like a little girl screaming obscenities if/when you fall off your problem.  So please refrain from the “YEEEAAHHHH F**K YEAHH!!!!!!” when sending or running around screaming “F****K!!!” if you fall.
[/list:u:bkyqaxlk]

Rtm reviews these and other points in the Tram guide as well, pg 12-13.

Last but not least, [b:bkyqaxlk]ALL areas throughout the Willow Creek Trail are still off limits to any climbing[/b:bkyqaxlk].  This includes the (roughly) 2-mile radius of wilderness area before the lake bed/drop off point on the trail.  This also includes the Frog Pond. The fine last we checked was [b:bkyqaxlk]$1000[/b:bkyqaxlk], probably a lot more now thanks to state budget cuts and fiscal reform.  I don’t know many climbers who can afford that kind of fine and no send is worth ponying up a grand. So let’s stay away from that area for the foreseeable future. I’ll make it a point though to discuss this with Ranger Sue next time I’m up there to see if we have any new updates on the area’s status.

Alright everyone, hope your climbing season is still going strong!  Just remember in a couple of months Tram should be thawed out and we’ll be on for another fun summer season!  Let’s keep things clean and enjoyable for everyone!

I just entered a commercial entitled &quot;Gravity&quot;, that I filmed at Stoney Point, for the &quot;Doritos Crash The Superbowl&quot; contest. 

Click here to view on the official Doritos website, [url:3udjh9o0]http&#58;//www&#46;crashthesuperbowl&#46;com/#/gallery?video=16876[/url:3udjh9o0]

As you will undoubtably notice, we did have to make some artistic choices over proper technique and etiquette. We were quite aware during filming that serious climbers could point out all the technical mistakes. If we followed proper protocol, there wouldn't be any jokes, which was the main reason behind the spot. We just wanted to provide some laughs, while still embracing the sport. 

Hope you all like it. 

If you do, please leave a comment and spread it around to your friends, the more the merrier. 

Thanks,

Hanging out in a climbing gym is the best way to hook up with boulderererers and also to get yer chops up (altho, I wouldn't do it!)!

You could head up to Tram and stalk pad people as they shuffle out to the rocks. Most boulderererers are more than happy to let someone tag along.

Good luck!";"67a42bd70c16fbddf0584964dc778f8d";"0";;"11ppzoxu";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

Just an update...So far the rangers are pleased with most of the cooperation they are getting this summer season. Very cool stuff and I'm glad to hear we're keeping things going in the right direction.

However, it is equally important to maintain a good relationship with not just the park rangers, but also the staff who run the PS Aerial Tramway.  I ran into some issues with the parking lot coordinator this weekend and was somewhat displeased when I asked if there were parking spots available in the upper two lots and he refused to answer my question!  Feeling a bit annoyed about this experience, I went to complain to his supervisor, and this is what I was told:

1.  Though there may be available spots in the mid to later afternoon in the upper two parking lots, they have to maintain flow of traffic such that it is efficient for both the trolley that takes people up to/down from the station as well as for those visitors leaving in their cars.  This is why they continue to direct traffic into the lower lots despite being mid to late afternoon.

2. We can ask (NICELY!!!!) to check for higher parking spots.  They may let us do this because we're climbing and they already know we're going to be here pretty late.  However if they say NO, then we need to leave it at that and take the trolley from the lower spots.

3. Some ass-clown climber almost ran over one of the parking attendants after they didn't let him pass.  The climber's response apparently was something like &quot;I'm parking up there no matter what!&quot;.  How'd they know he was a climber? ... The guy said he was climbing today and wanted to park up higher.  This was, beyond a doubt, a stupid thing to do.  We originally didn't have problems with the staff at the stations and now some one-off doosher is causing one.

The supervisor was cool but was disappointed with one or two folks that just don't get it.  Hopefully we won't hear of anything similar for the rest of the season but understand this; it won't matter what the rangers say or do if the staff at the Tram station don't let us up there to begin with.  These guys (especially Doug!) have been WAY cool to us thus far.  There is simply no need to cause problems with these folks.

Lastly, if you've heard of the incident described above and know who it is, please let myself or rTm know.  This boy needs some talkin' to...";"8cbf239ce014b33703a973ba41a24188";"0";;"1631z16h";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

I'm working on a short bouldering film for steele valley currently and am looking for people interested in doing interviews or climbing in it. This was originally going to be a film consisting of just my friends and I, but since we're limited to the v5/6 grade it would be nice to be able to showcase the harder climbs steele has to offer. As a filmmaker I'm interested in getting steele valley more exposure as currently I feel it's a hidden gem. 

The film will most likely be within the 15 minute range and showcase a number of the classics along with interviews talking about the area. It would be great to get as many people on board as possible. The film won't be a big budget production and it will just be released on the internet, but hopefully it will inspire others curious about the area to come check it out. I shot one video last summer on lip tricks traverse, but would like to do a much more comprehensive film.

1. They are now having climbers fill out individual passes in an effort to survey the areas in which we frequent.  So EVERYONE in your group has to fill one out.  I didn't ask but I assume they are collecting data to study impact, to monitor  the areas for any abuse or violations, and to figure out how to improve access.  Hopefully this will lead to something like what we currently have in the Buttermilks (established trails and markers for re-vegetation efforts)

2. No music PERIOD.  We're now restricted to iPods and other personal music gadgets.

3. Willow Creek is STILL closed to climbing.

4. Expect to get a small brochure on bouldering/climbing ethics this season.  Read up, take note and do not doubt for a second...they are passing this out to us for a reason.

Please remember, we are the ones making the most use of the wilderness area.  With that, it is our responsibility to keep it clean and maintain it!!!  So please remember to follow all rules and regulations.

This way we provide visitors with highly concentrated data for areas well known to us vs potentially inaccurate data on places we tend not to frequent.

know this response is late on a dead forum, but....

Theres actually quite a bit of lesser known rock around temecula.  Some is great, some is crap.  I grew up there, and started climbing by hiking around the hills in the area (no gyms at the time).  Some non-poaching spots (aka you wont get chased out of, cuz theres a few of those) you could hit up are the roadsides in rainbow, the Leon rocks and the Newport rocks in Menifee, Simpson park in hemet (and tank rock) steele valley in elsinore, blue jay campground off ortega, the tenaja falls gneiss boulder, squaw mountain past santa rosa plateau, rock mountain (top rope), the boulders near lake perris, jurupa flats and anza.  all those spots are 10-30 minutes from temecula. beyond that you have all the major spots (woodson, black mountain, santee, tramway, jupiters, jtree, rubidoux mtn).

The private areas have awesome stuff but you need to go with people who have access to them.  

tattvamasi is right as far as where the boulder is located.  however when youre on the road, it will be not too far from the freeway on the left on a hillside. there are some small walls in the same area as well.  without a guide youre gonna have to just wander around looking for it.";"bba9197418e676bdf820bfa18ad0deaf";"0";;"38dfhcaz";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"

In crystal cove your only decent option is the jumping rock about a mile south of corona, it is not Malta but there are some fun things to mess around on and for the adventurer the arch would be epic. Don't get your hopes up, it is just a fun and beautiful place to be. Best to visit at high tide so you can jump off the arch! and check out the tunnel that goes from the center of the north face into the archway, and be sure to get your timing right unless you want barnacle road rash.

As far as Abalone cove goes, don't go there expecting to climb. There are two lines that would need an adventuring/reckless ground up cleaning which would lead to a 20-30 foot jump into a doable(high tide) but precarious channel. Like the jumping rock I find this place awesome for hanging out and exploring. Bring snorkeling gear and food and do not go on weekends. Hike south through a huge tunnel or around the point to find an awesome black sand beach which leads to a nude beach which leads to another cool set of cliffs and reefs.";"03b2e4e2d46a6d4a0669c7d3b9cac198";"0";;"2rl7vi5y";"1";"0";;"0";"0";"0"
